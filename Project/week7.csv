0,David Fricke,2017-11-21T16:25:48.392Z,"Don Henley Talks 'Hotel California' Reissue, Eagles' Future","eagles, hotel california, don henley, don henley interview, deacon frey, glenn frey, vince gill eagles, eagles grand ole opry, don felder, eagles rolling stone",Rolling Stone,"""I was delighted at the energy and grittiness of the live tracks,"" Eagles singer-drummer Don Henley says of the previously unissued concert recordings – from October 1976 at the Forum in Los Angeles – added to the new 40th-anniversary reissue of the band's fifth studio album and biggest seller, Hotel California. ""We're a year late, technically speaking,"" Henley admits, noting the LP's original release in December 1976. ""But we had enough foresight to record those shows. I was surprised that we were doing songs from the album before it even came out. That was pretty ballsy.""     Henley is speaking the day after a milestone in Eagles' touring life: their October 29th debut performance at Nashville's country-radio landmark, the Grand Ole Opry, partly broadcast live by Sirius XM. That show also marked the end of the band's first tour since the 2016 death of Henley's co-founder, singer-guitarist Glenn Frey. ""We're taking it one step at a time,"" Henley says of the reborn lineup with country star Vince Gill and Frey's 23-year-old son Deacon on guitars and vocals. ""But it isn't so much about us as it is the songs. That's what people come to hear.""     It's hard to believe last night was Eagles' Opry debut. ""Lyin' Eyes"" was a Top 10 country hit in 1975.As seasoned as we are in stadiums and arenas, suddenly we're down to an intimate 4,000-seat venue where people are actually listening. There are planks they cut out of the stage at the Ryman Auditorium [the Opry's original home) and inserted into the stage at Opryland. We all took turns standing on it to see if anything would rub off.     Did you listen to the&nbsp;Grand Ole Opry radio show as a kid, growing up in Texas?I don't think we heard it on the radio. We watched it sometimes after it became a television show. What we had was what we called the country cousin of the Opry, which was The Louisiana Hayride out of Shreveport, Louisiana. Guys like Johnny Cash and George Jones – they went down to Shreveport. That's where Elvis Presley made his first live broadcast in 1954.     What was the impact on you musically? You took the turn to rock but listening to that music on The Louisiana Hayride clearly left a mark which can be heard on the first Eagles records.I would listen to the Hayride with my dad when I would go to work with him in the summertime. It was a 30-minute drive each way, and he would turn that program on. In the Sixties, rock &amp; roll became a cultural force, and country music was looked down on as square. Then Gram Parsons made it OK again. He invented the genre of long-haired country music when George Jones still had a flat-top haircut. That said to me, ""It's alright to blend these genres now. It reflects the old and new."" It seemed like something that I'd been looking for the whole time.     During last night's show, Gill dedicated ""New Kid in Town"" to Deacon. In fact, with Gill, there are two new kids in your band.It was a no-brainer for us to get Vince. Nobody else, other than Deacon, was even discussed. Glenn played golf with him. And Vince was in a band called Pure Prairie League. They did a style of music similar to ours – country-influenced pop. He fit like a glove. And his personality is great. He's just glad to be there. He's probably the happiest guy onstage.     It's interesting to hear Gill sing tunes associated with Glenn. Gill has a lighter tone in his voice.He has struck a nice balance between honoring what Glenn did, then putting his own little spin on it. In the beginning, he was trying to sing the songs exactly as Glenn sang them in phrasing and emphasis. But over the past few shows, he's put his own twist and interpretation on the songs. It makes it more authentic to him.     Deacon, in turn, had to grow up fast in his father's shoes.It's extraordinary what that young man has done. I saw him sing ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"" at his father's memorial service. As difficult as that might have been, he was so brave and composed. I'm sure, on the inside, he was churning. After a few months went by, I thought, ""Why not see if he would like to be in the band?""     Did you ever question whether it was right to continue without Glenn?Yes, I did. The only way it felt justified to me was to have family blood in the band. And I have to hand it to Deacon. We rehearsed for a couple of months. And his first gig with us was at Dodger Stadium [at the Classic West festival on July 15th]. He had done some gigs with his father – private parties, clubs, in front of maybe 200 people. To go from that to 55,000 people is extraordinary. I don't know many people who could have done that without freaking out.     Did you have any advice for him before going onstage that day?[Guitarist] Joe Walsh and I told him not to think about it too much [laughs] – just concentrate on the job. It's a double-edged sword for Deacon. He is honored to be carrying on his dad's legacy. On the other hand, it reminds him poignantly of his dad, when he is sitting in dressing rooms where his dad sat, when he's onstage where his dad was. There is the wonderful part of it and the sadness that goes with it.     I've told him that he doesn't need to feel obligated to do this indefinitely, that he doesn't have to stand in his father's shadow. If he wants to start his own band and write his own music, he should do that. He can do this as long as we all agree that we want to do it. He may want to carve out his own future, and that's just fine.     What is it like to play some of those Seventies hits – with that sardonic eye on consumerism and self-absorption – in the age of Trump? Most of this tour ran through the heart of his base: North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan.Which is why we don't speak about politics onstage. We let the music do the talking. People have their own interpretations of these songs. They may connect them to current events. A lot of people connect them to the past. And the past is always bathed in a golden light. It always looks better than it really was. I said something onstage last night: ""This song is from 1974. You thought things were crazy then."" But that's as far as I was gonna go. People can infer from that what they want.    We'd been doing ""The Last Resort"" [from Hotel California] in the set. It goes over like gangbusters in some parts of the country, because it really is a song about manifest destiny. But we pick and choose where to do it. We have too many ballads in the set anyway.     The reissue of Hotel California is the first time you have given an Eagles album the bonus-track treatment. Why did you pick that album instead of starting at the beginning, with your 1972 debut album, Eagles?We picked it because it had the most impact of our studio albums. The song itself has become one of those songs like ""Stairway to Heaven"" [laughs]. The album came out in December 1976. But it didn't really make an impact on the radio until February of  '77. I'm so thrilled we had the foresight to record those things at the Forum. I didn't even realize that we had done that – playing songs from Hotel California before it was out. We were doing things that nobody had heard on the radio yet.    How did they go over?[Laughs] I guess they went over OK. The live tracks were tighter than I remember them being. I thought we were all over the place. But it was pretty well played.     Did you have a sense, during the sessions for Hotel California, that you had turned an important corner as a writing and recording band – and in your commercial appeal?We realized we had taken another step in the evolution of the band, as songwriters and players, in the studio. We were fully aware that we were taking a leap forward. We had [guitarist] Don Felder in the band, and that was part of the edge.    You had that double-lead-guitar action with Felder and Walsh, who had just joined. Their pinpoint-harmony soloing in ""Hotel California"" speaks to your perfectionist streak as a band – that a guitar solo is not just about showing off. It has to have a melodic and narrative arc.Rather than perfectionism, I like to refer to it as craftsmanship. Songwriting and recording are an art, but they are also a craft. Don and Joe sat down and worked on those solos for days. Then [producer] Bill Szymczyk and I did some editing on those solos. Then they relearned the parts after we edited them together.    They'll be pissed at me for saying this [laughs], but that wasn't them just sitting down and spontaneously playing it in one take. That was weeks of work to get there. I'm not taking anything away. I have to give them props. They wrote those solos, worked over those harmony parts for days, then played them over and over again.     Is there anything else in the vaults worthy of future deluxe reissues? The Long Run was supposed to be a double album.We've been through the vaults three or four times at the urging of the record label. There's nothing else there. There were a few things that got started for The Long Run, but they didn't have enough steam. They never got finished. If I had my way, they would never be released. Glenn wouldn't want them out.     What are your plans for 2018 – more touring, the studio?There is nothing etched in stone. Deacon wants to start writing. I think our management is holding some venues, as managers are wont to do. Everyone is so tired from the last two years, what we've been through, that we need a break. After the holidays, as we have traditionally done, we will get together in January and talk about what we want to do – whether we want to do anything, how much we want to do, when to do it. As Glenn used to say, we run this band on a yearly basis. That's still the way it is.     I turned 70 this past July. [Bassist] Timothy Schmit turns 70 today [October 30th]. Joe's 70th is coming up at the end of November. If we can go out and deliver quality performances that our fans have come to expect and that our fans deserve, then we'll probably do some more shows. But when the quality of the performance starts diminishing, I think we'll need to think about hanging it up.    Last night at the Opry, when you opened with the cover of Steve Young's ""Seven Bridges Road,"" you started with that full set of voices in bracing, a cappella harmony – as if to say, ""We're still capable of this.""We picked that as our starter because it does showcase everything and everybody: ""We're still doing OK."""
1,Van Sias,2017-10-19T15:17:00.000Z,INXS' 'Kick': 10 Things You Didn't Know,"inxs kick, inxs, inxs devil inside, inxs need you tonight, inxs never tear us apart, never tear us apart, michael hutchence, inxs michael hutchence, inxs hits",Rolling Stone,"During their first 10 years as a band, INXS went from playing pubs across Australia to filling modest-size venues in the United States. But that wasn't enough for the group, made up of singer Michael Hutchence; guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly; bassist Garry Gary Beers; and the brothers Farriss – guitarist Tim, keyboardist and guitarist Andrew, and drummer Jon.The result of their rising ambition was&nbsp;Kick, their sixth studio LP, released 30 years ago this week. With its sensuous, danceable blend of rock, funk, pop and blues, the album peaked at Number Three on the Billboard charts, surpassing their earlier career-best ranking of Number 11 with 1985's&nbsp;Listen Like Thieves, which generated their first Top 10 hit, ""What You Need.""Kick has been certified platinum six times over in the United States, and has reportedly sold 20 million copies worldwide. Four singles off the album reached the Top 10 in the U.S., with ""Need You Tonight"" becoming the band's first and only Number One. A special 30th-anniversary reissue of Kick will be released next month. In honor of the milestone, here are 10 facts about the album, from its initial reception to connections with Eighties vampire movies.1. Their label hated the album.After the success of Listen Like Thieves, the band teamed back up with legendary producer Chris Thomas to take their collective efforts a step further. Recording for a good portion of 1987, both in their native Australia and in France, the band felt they had built upon the possibilities opened up by ""What You Need."" After the album was finished, longtime manager Chris Murphy took it to Atlantic Records president Doug Morris. ""He put his feet up on the desk and closed his eyes from the minute the record went on to the minute it finished,"" Murphy said in INXS KICK: the Words, a book that accompanied the&nbsp;anniversary reissue of the album. ""When it stopped, he said, 'I'll give you a million dollars to go and record another album. This is not happening, this is shit.'"" After that meeting, in which he failed to persuade Morris how ""Need You Tonight"" fit perfectly into the zeitgeist, Murphy received a call from the worldwide president of Polygram, who according to Murphy, asked, ""What the fuck are Andrew and Michael doing?"" And just for good measure, the head of Warner Music Australia echoed those sentiments. ""Three different record companies with no interrelationship are all telling me the same thing,"" Murphy said. One positive response did come in, giving Murphy hope to press forward. ""I got a call from my product manager in France,"" Murphy said. ""He wanted to tell me that the band were geniuses, and that ""Never Tear Us Apart"" will be one of the biggest singles he'd ever heard and all the other tracks were brilliant. That gave me the spirit.""2. A renegade move from their manager saved the LP.After the initial bouts of rejection, Murphy, in an intrepid move, arranged a somewhat-clandestine meeting with Atlantic's radio promotions executives to play them some of the songs. While the rock and R&amp;B department staffers couldn't figure out what to do with the heady mix presented before them, Andrea Guinness, who spearheaded college radio promotions, enamored with what she heard. Murphy booked a college tour – on his dime and the band's – while the fate of the album was still up in the air. As ""Need You Tonight"" took off on college radio and the band sold out shows across campuses around the country, the efforts to make a major breakthrough in the U.S. began to pay off. Atlantic added the album to its fall release schedule. But the struggle was intense and according to the band's official biography,&nbsp;INXS Story to Story, the members didn't know how drastic the measures were that had to be taken. ""I risked every dollar they had and every dollar I had on that tour,"" Murphy said. ""If it failed, there would have been a mutiny. It would have been the end of everything and I knew it.""3. Hutchence and Andrew Farriss wrote all 11 of the original songs.Buoyed by the success of ""What You Need,"" Hutchence and Andrew Farriss – the primary lyricist and songwriter, respectively – producer Thomas and manager Murphy wanted to bank everything on the Hutchence-Farriss partnership: Those two would write every song on the Listen Like Thieves&nbsp;follow-up. ""That was the fundamental difference on Kick, Thomas said in Story to Story. ""That songwriting partnership certainly worked – and it worked better than ever on that album. The massive success of 'What You Need' gave Andrew and Michael the optimism and confidence they needed to go further."" As Beers told Rolling Stone in 1988, ""We understood that Andrew writes the best music, and Michael obviously writes the best lyrics, because he sings them. So we left it totally up to them.""4. ""Need You Tonight""&nbsp;came about at the last minute.During the first phase of recording, with a European tour on the horizon, the band laid down a number of tracks for the album. However, Thomas thought that the band was still missing a major single, so Andrew Farriss and Hutchence were charged to come up with one. On his way to collaborate with Hutchence in the Hong Kong apartment he shared with bandmate Jon Farriss, Andrew came up with the familiar riff to ""Need You Tonight""&nbsp;just as he got in the cab on the way to the airport. He told the driver he forgot something and needed to run back up to his place, where he proceeded to record a rough demo with the riff, a drum track and the bass parts. When he made it to Hong Kong, he gave the tape to Hutchence, who according to Farriss in INXS Kick: The Words, said ""'I think this is really interesting, give me five or 10 minutes,' and he came up with, again, most of what was on the finished version.""5. ""Never Tear Us Apart"" started on a very different path.With Hutchence's plaintive vocals, a distinctive guitar riff and the yearning cry of Pengilly's sax solo, ""Never Tear Us Apart"" stands as one of definitive rock ballads of the late Eighties. How the song turned out is a far cry from its earliest incarnation. ""'Never Tear Us Apart' was a piano song originally,"" Thomas said in Story to Story. ""It was a Fats Domino, bluesy, kind of Rolling Stonesy, early '60s song. I heard it and thought we could do more [and] came up with the idea to substitute strings for the piano,"" Thomas said. ""That changed everything. It was what the song deserved, because in structure and lyrics, it was so strong already."" Andrew Farriss agreed with the decision, later telling MusicRadar.com that the strings ""have the right kind of empathy for the vocal."" He also expressed his appreciation for his longtime songwriting partner Hutchence, who died in 1997, and his particular gifts. ""He didn't play an instrument, but his voice and his words were his instruments. He was phenomenal.""6. Kick features the only cover song on an INXS studio LP.Along with 11 original songs written by Hutchence and Andrew Farriss, the band squeezed in an update of a song they had some familiarity with in ""The Loved One."" The song is a cover of a track by Australian band the Loved Ones, released in 1966. INXS took its first crack at the song in 1981, when it was released as an Australia-only single and video. The band covered it again for Kick, offering a different arrangement from their own original interpretation. It's the only song the band has covered that made it onto one of their albums. ""Good Times,""&nbsp;a version of a 1968 song original recorded by the Easybeats that featured fellow Australian Jimmy Barnes, landed on the soundtrack for The Lost Boys, with that track cracking the Billboard Top 50.7. Kick finally broke INXS in England – thanks to a ""Need You Tonight"" remix.While INXS first topped the U.S. charts with ""Need You Tonight,"" the band had some experience achieving that feat in other countries before, when ""Original Sin,"" from The Swing went to Number One in Australia and France back in 1984. However, breaking through in England proved to be difficult. When ""Need You Tonight"" came out there, it initially only went to Number 58. After it got a remix by Julian Mendelsohn, the song made it to Number Two, and Kick ended up becoming the band's first BPI-certified platinum album. In 1991, INXS would headline a show at London's Wembley Stadium in front of 72,000 fans.8. For the ""Devil Inside"" clip, the band cashed in on a favor from Lost Boys director Joel Schumacher.The budget for The Lost Boys was $8.5 million, and not much was left for the film's soundtrack. Joel Schumacher reportedly made arrangements with INXS and Lou Gramm (of Foreigner fame, who was also part of the project): He would direct future videos of theirs if they were to appear on the soundtrack. While he didn't collaborate with Gramm later, he did team up with INXS for the ""Devil Inside"" clip, which echoed the beloved vampire flick, featuring the band performing in a bar on a Calfornia beach at night before a crowd of surfers and bikers. The video was nominated for Best Editing at the '88 MTV VMAs, losing to ""Need You Tonight""/""Mediate.""9. The album's string of hits kept Kick on the charts for more than a year.Kick maintained a presence on the Billboard Top 200 albums for well over a year, due in no small part to an aggressive singles campaign. ""Need You Tonight,"" ""Devil Inside"" and ""New Sensation"" went to Numbers One, Two and Three, respectively, while ""Never Tear Us Apart"" peaked at Number Seven. The title track, which Hutchence called ""the great Zen song of all time"" in 1991 (""Sometimes you kick/sometimes you get kicked"") didn't reach the Hot 100, but it did make it to Number 33 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Songs Chart. The follow-up to that, ""Mystify,"" followed a similar path, making it to Number 17 on the Mainstream Rock chart.10. The band partied with Guns N' Roses and Iggy Pop after a surreal post-Kick gig.In September 1988, INXS headlined an MTV-sponsored gig during its Calling All Nations tour that was the epitome of diversity: It featured the Smithereens; Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers; Iggy Pop; and perhaps, most surprisingly, Guns N' Roses, who were the openers. The Gunners were booked for the show months in advance, and by the time it happened, they were getting their own taste of fame. As the date approached, GN'R wanted to back out – to no avail. According to Story to Story, Hutchence and Andrew Farriss met Axl Rose and Slash before showtime, and Hutchence offered Rose some tips on handling success. ""There is always going to be someone greater than you – always,"" he said. ""And you know what? So what, man. That doesn't matter. Just do fine work and enjoy yourself. Believe me, that's what it's all about."" The rockers didn't take Hutchence's words entirely to heart as they cut their set short. As Pengilly wrote in his expansive tour diary, ""Guns N' Roses finished early (sounded terrible)."" But there was a celebration with most of the acts afterward, he wrote: ""Bit of a party backstage and then some back to the bar at the hotel and eventually most off to the M.H. suite for party till very late, along with Iggy Pop, our L.A. friends, Duff (from Guns N' Roses) ..."""
2,David Browne,2017-11-08T18:27:46.917Z,Jerry Garcia Band's Ron Tutt Looks Back on 'Cats Under the Stars' Sessions,"jerry garcia, jerry garcia band, jerry garcia cats under the stars, ron tutt, ron tutt jerry garcia, cats under the stars, ron tutt elvis, ron tutt neil diamond, ron tutt neil diamond",Rolling Stone,"Last week, Ron Tutt, best known as Elvis Presley's drummer from 1969 to 1977, did something he hadn't done in nearly 40 years: He listened to the Jerry Garcia Band's Cats Under the Stars. Appreciated as Garcia's most fully realized and produced solo album outside the Grateful Dead, Cats Under the Stars features at least one Garcia–Robert Hunter gem (""Rubin and Cherise""), unusually layered production, and the drumming of Tutt, who became a recurring member of Garcia's band in 1975. With the 40th anniversary of Cats Under the Stars approaching in April – a special vinyl edition of the album has just been released to commemorate it – Tutt, who has largely remained silent about his days with Garcia, spoke with RS about that unusual moment in his and Garcia's career. (Tutt left the Garcia band in 1978 and in 1981 joined Neil Diamond's band, where he's been holding down the beat ever since.)So many people who have worked on Cats Under the Stars have spoken about Garcia, but you never have. Any reason why?Well, as far as music fans or drum fans or whatever, they all have a  tendency to go towards Elvis. And like it or not, that's what I've been saddled with, you know.So it's not because you have particularly bad memories.Well, I just remember the good things, that's for sure. You got to. I just remember laughing a lot and having a good time musically, so I have nothing but good memories.You first worked with Garcia on his 1974 solo album Compliments of Garcia. How did that come about?John Kahn [Garcia's bassist and co-producer] had evidently wanted to get together with me in the studio 'cause they were going to do a studio album. So we got together in L.A. and did the album and we had so much fun hanging out and playing. It was relaxed and we just hit it off so well that they said, ""Hey, would you be interested in coming up and doing some gigs that we do? We play at this club up in Berkeley called the Keystone."" So one thing led to another and we started doing a few gigs, which took on several different postures – the Jerry Garcia Band, Legion of Mary and so on. Elvis' schedule was basically twice a year in Vegas. And in between those two gigs we were open to whatever we wanted to do, so it gave me opportunities to pick and choose a little bit.Since you hadn't met Garcia before, what were your earliest impressions?He was very loose and laid back. He was really open to everybody's ideas and just wanted to have a good time and hang out and play some good music. He was a pretty simple guy when it came to that.What surprised you about him?Well, his devotion to his instrument. He had his guitar with him at all times. When we would go to the gig, he'd go into the dressing room and sit there and play the whole time instead of resting and hanging out. And when it came to composing his solos, he was very thoughtful. If he was playing a tender ballad, he could build it soft and then get it to where it was roaring towards the end. A lot of people don't give him the credit he deserves when it comes to that.Talk about those Keystone gigs. I'd imagine that experience was very different from an Elvis gig.Extremely different from everything you can think of, starting with the presentation. Jerry was a real purist, shall I say. One time he said to me, ""I don't believe in a lot of talk on a microphone – look what's been done to people over the years, you know. Hitler made pretty bad use of microphone with people and I don't believe in jiving people."" He would come out at the beginning of the night and say ""Hi ya,"" and at end of the night ""See ya."" I'd always laugh because one night I'd be in Vegas playing with rhinestone two-piece outfits and the next night I'd be out with Garcia with the tie-dye and a pair of jeans. Socially speaking it was really different.For Garcia's 1976 album Reflections, you cut a version of ""Mystery Train."" Did Jerry ever grill you about Elvis?Nah. I think he really appreciated what he did but he was never a quote-unquote fan or never wanted to know inside information.In terms of what they expected from you as a drummer, how were Garcia and Elvis different?Elvis' music was a lot more in your face; you could never play enough. But with Jerry we never talked about it, but I just knew my role with that band, no matter what configuration it was, was to help keep it together. We weren't there to do flashy solos. I don't know that I ever even did a solo. That wasn't our purpose. I almost liken it to a jazz gig in the sense that the songs had as we call 'em a head, a front, and then everybody played as much as they wanted to play and then did the out and that was it. There wasn't much rehearsal.Cats Under the Stars seemed as if it was going to be a fresh start for Garcia and the band – an album of all original material, well produced, and with a new solo record deal. Was that your impression?They had contacted to me to do the thing for the summer and we had signed the contract for the group with Arista and Clive Davis. They asked me if I would consider staying in the area for a while. So I said sure, so we leased a house in Mill Valley and basically moved in for the summer. It was a neat time. We used the Dead's rehearsal hall [Front Street]. It never really was a serious studio, but it had a pretty decent sound.Jerry would often call Cats Under the Stars his best album. Did he express his goals for the record to you?He was ready for another chapter in his music. He was ready to move into – I don't know how to say it, it's not necessarily pop music, but he was ready to move on to find something that was more reflective of what he was writing and thinking about at that time, instead of doing cover songs like Smokey Robinson songs. All those songs are great, and they're fun to play, but as far as the commercial aspect of it, he wasn't above making money.	I think he enjoyed the freedom we gave him to be able to do just different things he would always wanted to try. So in that sense it was experimental and he got a chance to just try different musical styles and genres. I think he needed that kind of a challenge. It opened him to a whole different approach. It was different than, say, Legion of Mary, where it was kind of a jam band [laughs].What did you make of the album after hearing it again after so long?  I'd forgotten how much production had gone into it, but not in a bad way.  Strangely enough, I thought there were certain tracks there that were real Beatle-esque, real McCartney-and-Lennon–sounding. I thought some of it was very inventive. Some of it was straight-ahead like ""Rhapsody in Red."" And ""Love in the Afternoon"" was a really cool thing, kind of pseudo-reggae. That's just something we all played and felt we thought would work. Jerry was never any kind of guy to ever say, ""Hey, try this and we need so-and-so people for this."" He was very loyal to his band in that way. Did you ever see members of the Dead hanging around?No, no. Every once in a while, one of 'em would show up if they had to go to the office or something. But no, we didn't do any hanging out.Elvis died that summer [1977]. Were you making that record with Jerry when that happened?Yeah, we had quit for that weekend and I'd driven back home to L.A. And it was that weekend we heard the news.You left the Garcia Band soon after. What happened?We were at a point [in the Garcia Band] where the band had gone as far as it was going to go musically and personally with the personnel that was there. It was a wait-and-see-what's-going-to-happen kind of a thing. After Elvis died, I had to make a decision so I immediately jumped back into the studios in L.A.Did the drug scene around Garcia have anything to do with your decision?Well, I think it was a sign of the times. Everybody was, you know, sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll, as they say. But it was more drugs and rock &amp; roll than anything else [laughs]! It had its pull, there's no doubt about it. But I don't know it was something that everyone was doing and experimenting with.You hooked up again with Garcia for some shows in 1981 but then joined Neil Diamond – another big change, I would think.Yeah, yeah. Definitely a change. Neil was keeping me busy and [Garcia] came to an end, so to speak. It's a shame because I learned a lot from Jerry. He felt lighting and sound and the atmosphere in which the sound was created were important. We looked for special places to play. These colosseums and arenas are not built for acoustics. They're built to bring lots of people together so promotion can make a lot of money. Which is OK; it's our way of life. But that wasn't the driving factor with Jerry. I guess he saw enough of that with the Dead that he felt when it came to doing gigs with his band, he'd find special venues. He believed in music and no hype.&nbsp;"
3,Dan Hyman,2018-01-11T20:34:21.946Z,Ralph Steadman: Legendary 'Fear and Loathing' Illustrator Talks Making First Rap Album Art,"Ralph Steadman, Huncho Jack, Travis Scott, Huncho Jack art, Quavo",Rolling Stone,"""I certainly don't keep up with hip-hop but I'm trying to now,"" says iconic British illustrator and painter Ralph Steadman, best known as the twisted mind behind the dark, grotesque, hilarious, disturbing art that accompanied the early-1970s gonzo journalistic screeds of the late Hunter S. Thompson, including his 1972 novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and various Rolling Stone covers.What made Steadman, 81, decide to expand his musical horizons? In early December he was enlisted to draw the cover art for Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, the debut album from Huncho Jack, the hip-hop duo of Travis Scott and Quavo of Migos. ""I listened to their music, realized the energy in their performances and translated that performance visually,"" Steadman says of the project, which he completed in less than a week's time. When the rappers saw his completed work – a demented, slightly sinister portrait of the pair, flanked by cacti, crows and bats, all in the artist's signature scribble – they told him over the phone, ""It's a vibe."" Steadman, not one to keep up with the latest in hip-hop vernacular, admits he had no idea what they were talking about. But, as he notes with a laugh, ""I said, 'OK. I must have caught the vibes a bit then, I guess.'""
Before taking on the Huncho Jack project, Steadman had never listened to either of the rappers' music. ""That's the weird part about it,"" he says. ""They came out of nowhere to me. I'd never heard of them. The rapper culture wasn't familiar to me. And apparently they're big in America. Aren't they associated with the Kardashian family or something?"" He learned they were fans of his Fear and Loathing work, as well as drawings of his that had appeared in the pages of Rolling Stone. ""They sent me sort of photocopies of lots of my pictures from Rolling Stone and Fear and Loathing and all that stuff,"" Steadman recalls. ""I sensed that they had picked up on my drawings with Hunter Thompson. I also sensed that they wanted portraits in the gonzo manner. They liked cactus plants, bats as well, and parallel lines, like the desert scenes from the Las Vegas drawings."" Ultimately, Steadman explains, it was the rappers' dreadlocks that drew him in. ""I felt like, oh, this is interesting. Most of my friends haven't gotten any hair anymore,"" he laughs. ""I just really thought they were quite funny. And I wondered what I could do with them or how I could draw them. And I just did it in the best way I could.""Steadman's association with contemporary music ""makes me feel old,"" he offers. ""But I was flattered that they should even bother in thinking that was the thing they wanted. It's kind of nice. It's really a compliment – and particularly in the musical world where all sorts of new things are happening."" Right now, however, if there's one thing that's continually holding the attention of the man who drew a decaying Nixon on a 1973 Rolling Stone cover, it's President Donald Trump. ""It's just so shocking and so terrible – the shock and horror,"" he says of our commander-in-chief. Despite not living in the United States, ""we're all to blame,"" he says. ""He must have aged a lot of people."" Some of Steadman's most famous works were overtly political so it's hardly a surprise to learn he's drawn Trump several times in the past year. In addition to depicting Trump as a baby ""shitting out the American flag""' for his ""Porky Pie"" drawing for The New Statesman, as well as posting on his Instagram an image of Trump decapitating the Statue of Liberty, with the caption ""Statue of Liberty takers,"" Steadman reveals he's also drawn Trump as Trumpelstiltskin. ""I don't think he cares about anyone,"" the artists says of the President. ""His wife's a trophy and she looks as if she's been caught in the headlights.""When asked what Thompson would have made of Trump, Steadman can only laugh. ""Jesus, he would have gone after him, I think. I cannot imagine what he would have thought of him. I wish he'd stayed around for this. It would have been great. That would have been something. He really could bring a President down."""
4,David Browne,2017-11-16T19:10:00.000Z,Inside the New Grateful Dead Musical,"grateful dead musical, red roses green gold, michael norman man, jerry garcia, box of rain, robert hunter, grateful dead play, grateful dead off broadway",Rolling Stone,"Musical-theater productions tend to gestate for long periods, but&nbsp;Red Roses, Green Gold, the Off-Broadway show featuring the music of the Grateful Dead that opened in October, still seems like a special case. Playwright Michael Norman Mann first had the idea for the show when he attended a Dead gig in the Nineties and remarked to a friend that he thought their songs could be turned into show tunes.""He took my beer away from me,"" Mann recalls, ""and said, 'You're done.'"" A few years later, when Mann got serious about creating a musical using Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter songs, skepticism prevailed: ""Even people who understood the band looked at me and said, 'What are you talking about? You think you can do that with these songs?' I would say, 'As a matter of fact, I do.'""Twenty years and several incarnations later, Mann has achieved the seemingly impossible with Red Roses, Green Gold. Set at the fictitious ""Palace Saloon and Mining Company in Cumberland, USA,"" the show, currently playing at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York's Greenwich Village, uses 18 Dead classics largely from the American Beauty and Workingman's Dead era, along with one new Hunter song, ""Drunkard's Carol."" The musical centers on a quasi-Appalachian family wrestling with ways to hold onto their bar and mine, and the songs – which feature Hunter's tales of gamblers, devils, and rogues in them – help accentuate that story.&nbsp;""We're treading in between a musical and Dead music,"" says co-producer Gigi Pritzker. ""So we're not going to go into 'Space.' No drum solo! But I love the way the songs allude to the story line but without the characters breaking into song to give you more plot. The songs are next to the plot.""Prior to getting to work on Red Roses, Green Gold, Mann, who graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz (coincidentally, currently home to the Dead's archives), had already written several plays, including the award-winning Box 27, about gays in the military. In 1997, he approached the Dead's publishing company, Ice Nine, for permission to use their songs in a possible musical and was encouraged to proceed, with input from Hunter. ""I didn't want to make it biographical,"" says Mann. ""I didn't want to write a play about the band or about people following the band on tour or a play about Sixties psychedelia. Hair covered that whole scene better than a Johnny-come-lately would."" Since he wasn't portraying band members, he didn't need permission from the surviving ""core four"" of the Dead.First called Cumberland Blues and using different characters and plots than the current show, the production opened in San Francisco in 1998. But despite positive reviews, it shut down after less than a week. ""It closed under the weight of its own expectations,"" Mann says. ""The lesson I learned was to slow down and be patient and not try to rush things.""In the meantime, Mann also worked with Hunter on Shakedown Street, a one-shot Dead musical that featured swing-jazz versions of later songs (""Shakedown Street,"" ""Stella Blue,"" ""Help on the Way/Slipnot!"", ""Loose Lucy"") in a detective-noir setting. Cumberland Blues was itself revived in 2005 at a theater festival. But it wasn't until five years ago that another overhauled crack at the show – now renamed Red Roses, Green Gold and featuring new characters– began taking shape. From the first show, Mann learned several lessons. ""The early production focused more on the dark and brooding,"" he says. ""We had 'Black Peter' in there. But not everyone wants to watch a man physically dying on stage. And I learned that if I wasn't careful, I could be repetitive. I'd want 'Candyman' and 'Friend of the Devil,' but they cover the same ground.""Mounting the show still presented challenges. Many big-money investors shied away. ""Some were like, 'I don't know if I want to touch this,'"" says Pritzker, a longtime stage and film producer who was also behind the Million Dollar Quartet musical based around Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. ""It was a little out of the box for a lot of people."" Pritzker and her partner Ted Rawlins' company, MWM Live, wound up providing the investment money themselves; to keep costs down, they decided on a small Off-Broadway theater instead of the Great White Way. The show's 11-person cast is among the most versatile in contemporary New York theater; throughout the show, each sings, acts and plays multiple instruments. But most had no knowledge of the Dead, so for the musical-supervisor job, Pritzker approached Jeff Chimenti, the longtime post-Garcia Dead accompanist who was in Furthur and now holds down the keyboard slot in Dead &amp; Co. ""They knew my background and needed some guidance,"" Chimenti says of the cast. ""Most of them didn't have any history with this music. I was teaching them as much as I could.""The resulting show features arrangements that are sometimes close to the Dead's originals and sometimes not. ""I wanted certain songs to be very rock-style like the Dead,"" says Mann, ""but I also wanted almost a throwback to the Sixties, when someone like Robert Goulet would walk to the front of the stage and you knew he was going to sing a ballad. I wanted to make 'Bertha' and 'The Wheel' big-time musical theater numbers. I step on Deadheads' toes every once in a while. Deadheads aren't as militant as Trekkies, but they share a lot of similarities.""For Chimenti, the ""a-ha"" moment arrived during rehearsal as he watched two of the cast members sing an unplugged ""Box of Rain."" ""When I realized it was going to be a duet, I was like, 'Wow, how's that going to sound?'"" he says. ""But it was thrilling to see it when it first happened. This isn't a show or a concert and people can't expect to hear the Dead versions of these songs. They have to be open to it.""Currently Red Roses, Green Gold is booked until January, with a possible extension. Mann knows the initial skepticism he encountered nearly two decades ago remains, but is hopeful his show will be given a chance. ""On opening night, people had no idea what to expect,"" he says. ""And if that works against us, then it works against us. But I think it works for us. In musical theater, there's nothing like being pleasantly surprised."""

But as the 21-year-old Bennett will tell you, it's he, not Chance, who has been leading the charge in their native Chicago for years now. ""I was one of the first people to do independent distribution in Chicago,"" Bennett, who released his second album, Restoration of an American Idol earlier this year, tells Rolling Stone. ""I tried to sell music before my brother. I'm actually the reason Chance decided he was going to stream his music. And he also realized that if he streamed it he could get those Grammys. The funny thing about it is that even though Chance was touring [at my age]. I'm almost positive he wasn't making as much money as I am.""&nbsp;""Of course nowadays Chance is a baller,"" Taylor says with a laugh. ""He's doing just fine.""Talking to the younger Bennett is not unlike consulting a music-industry textbook. The MC will gladly hold forth on everything from his knowledge of split sheets to royalty payments, master recordings and publishing. And he's certainly unafraid to voice his disdain for major record labels and their signing tactics.&nbsp;""What record labels do is they say, 'When you sign to us you don't have to worry about anything else,'"" Bennett explains. ""'You want that watch? You get that watch. You want that car? You can get that car. You want to buy your mom a house? Why won't you buy your mom a house.' But a lot of artists don't know their advances are recoupments. Nobody gets paid a large sum of money and never has to pay it back. You pay it back through your record sales, your touring, your merchandise, features, agency deals, etc. Before you look up you've spent all this money. Now you owe all this money, and if you can't pay it back the label will drop you, shelf you, and they might even sue you.""I'm friends with a lot of big artists and they're signed to labels and they have no idea what kind of deals they're in,"" he continues. ""Everything is about percentages to these labels. Everything is about numbers. Everything is about commas. And they don't really give a fuck if you ever become the biggest artist in the world or if you're just another Joe what's-his-name.""Ultimately Bennett says it was a no-brainer then for him to remain independent. ""Me, as well as my brother, we're really some do-it-yourself people,"" he says. ""Don't chase the blogs. Let the blogs chase you. Don't chase the playlists. Let the playlists chase you. You be the best artist you can be and when you work hard independently eventually those opportunities will come."" It's why the rapper formed his own record label, Tay Bennett Entertainment, and recently signed his first artist, the Chicago-based singer-rapper Bianca Shaw. Today, Shaw debuts her soulful new Bennett-featuring single ""So High"" via Rolling Stone. Produced by Bennett's longtime collaborator, Ludlow, the track has an airy, guitar-anchored vibe, and according to the producer was based on a track he initially named ""Pizza"" because ""it was so tasty."" ""The chemistry is undeniable,"" Shaw says of her and Bennett playing off one another on ""So High."" ""As soon as we made it, we both looked at each other like, 'This is the one.'""Raised in the West Chicago neighborhood of Lawndale, Shaw took in a diverse musical diet as a child, listening to everything from Nas, Eminem and Missy Elliott to Erykah Badu and Sam Cooke. She played in a ""girl band"" with her younger sisters and played drums in her church choir. Last year, when performing as a member of a band auditioning to back Taylor, the rapper's dad, Ken Bennett (who is now Shaw's manager), discovered her. ""My dad called me and said, 'You need to listen to this girl. She's real good!'"" Taylor recalls. ""My dad has great taste in music so I took him seriously.""Taylor agreed. Since signing to TBE, Shaw and Bennett have grown close, as she works on a forthcoming EP and full-length album. ""I feel like they've adopted me into their family,"" Shaw says. She'd long respected Taylor and Chance's independent streak, and to that end, she says, ""I want to follow in those same footsteps. I feel like I'm in great hands.""""What a lot of artists need is a solid foundation,"" Taylor offers of his mantra as a label boss. ""As big as I want my artists to be, I want them to be happy."""
6,Kory Grow,2018-01-19T19:06:23.752Z,Def Leppard Explain Why They Finally Embraced Streaming,"def leppard,def leppard interview,joe elliott,joe elliott interview,def leppard streaming,joe elliott streaming,def leppard catalogue,def leppard spotify,def leppard tidal,def leppard apple music",Rolling Stone,"For years, Def Leppard were well situated among the ranks of Garth Brooks and Tool as holdouts on streaming services – artists with large, multiplatinum catalogues that still didn't feel comfortable with the pros and cons of subscription-based music schemes. The hard rockers had long been at war with their label, Universal, about the topic, even recording self-described ""forgeries"" of ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" and ""Rock of Ages"" that were self-released so they would earn what they considered a fair wage. ""We just sent [the label] a letter saying, 'No matter what you want, you are going to get ""no"" as an answer, so don't ask,'"" Elliott said in 2012.But things have changed. Beginning Friday, fans can stream all of the band's major releases, going back to their 1979 debut, The Def Leppard E.P., on all major streaming services. ""We needed the right deal for the band,"" frontman Joe Elliott tells Rolling Stone. ""We weren't going to be victims of the industry. We signed our deal with Mercury many, many decades ago when there was no digital part of the record deal. So when [our contract ended] in 2009, we were free to do whatever we wanted to do. We were so busy touring and not worrying about the back catalogue – because people were still buying CDs – that we weren't sure about [embracing] streaming.""Elliott recalls label reps telling them that streaming was the great new thing but feeling incredulous after seeing artists releasing songs that got ""125,000,000 listens and a check for $120."" The singer says the band isn't in it for the money, but that he wanted a digital deal to be fair. ""We came to the conclusion that it's not going to do us any harm, but the deal had to be right,"" he says. ""These things just don't happen overnight.""The band was on board to put its music on streaming ""quite awhile ago,"" by Elliott's estimation, but the deals kept falling apart. One concern they had was getting everything out at once across all major services. ""We didn't want certain albums on one service and others through another one,"" he says. ""So negotiating everything with different places just takes time."" So they waited for the right opportunity to come to them. ""It's not like a make-or-break thing, whether we do it or not,"" Elliott says. ""So we didn't and just went off on our own.""One of the reasons things worked out this time, the singer says, was a regime shift at Universal. ""It makes life easier,"" he says. ""We were able to come to the decision that it was the right thing to do and have it all come out at once. So now you've got everything form the very first EP we did back in 1979 – which is what got us our record deal in the first place – all the way up to the last album that came out in 2015.""The last puzzle piece for the band was the timing. ""We don't like things to dribble,"" Elliott says. ""We don't like to release information in drips and drops if there's no big pow. We like a good explosion in our announcement."" He laughs. They timed the announcement to coincide with a massive summer tour with Journey. ""It's put the excitement back into this thing we've been doing for 40 years,"" he says. ""It makes it worthwhile, really.""&nbsp;"
7,Elias Leight,2018-01-25T14:31:00.000Z,How the Grammys Finally Got Woke,"Grammys, beyonce, Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, ",Rolling Stone,"On February 12th, 2017, Frank Ocean published a blunt dismissal of the Grammys on Tumblr. ""You know what's really not 'great tv,' guys?"" Ocean asked. ""[Taylor Swift's] 1989 getting album of the year over [Kendrick Lamar's] To Pimp a Butterfly. Hands down one of the most 'faulty' TV moments I've seen."" Ocean's post reflected a widely held view: At best, the Grammys appeared to reflect what he called ""cultural bias""; at worst, the Recording Academy was systematically ignoring the work of innovative minority acts. His opinion was supported by Kanye West, who called the Grammys ""way off and completely out of touch,"" and Drake, who reportedly refused to submit his Views album for Grammy consideration (following Ocean, who did the same with Blonde).Those artists had a strong case: Album of the Year has gone to a white act nine years in a row, and commercially successful, critically adored records by Ocean (Channel Orange), Kendrick Lamar (both good kid, m.A.A.d city&nbsp;and To Pimp a Butterfly) and Beyoncé (both Beyoncé and Lemonade) have failed to win the award five years straight. No rapper has ever won Record of the Year; the only non-white R&amp;B singer to take home that honor is Bruno Mars – when he was a featured singer on Mark Ronson's ""Uptown Funk."" The 2018 Grammy nominations, however, are different. Four non-white acts are up for Album of the Year (Childish Gambino, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar and Bruno Mars). And five are up for Record of the Year (Gambino, Jay-Z, Lamar, Mars, and the ""Despacito"" team of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee). ""This is the year where people are saying, 'Oh wow, they got it right,'"" says Tunde Balogun, co-founder of creative agency LVRN, whose artists 6lack and D.R.A.M. both received nominations this year. This year also marks the first time in history that an all-minority slate of artists are nominated for Record of the Year, and the first time a Spanish-language song has ever been up for Record of the Year (""Despacito""). ""I'm very happy with the nominations,"" adds Chris Anokute, a manager, former major-label A&amp;R and Recording Academy voter. ""It's a new day for the Grammys.""&nbsp;The Academy has been attempting to make its Grammy-nomination process more representative for years. Anokute remembers attending long meetings ""about how we can make it more diverse and be a better partner to the music community as a whole."" An important part of this effort involves informing people who are eligible to vote but unaware they can participate in the Grammy process. Though musicians can join the voter pool as soon as they have six credits on commercial music releases, many people who qualify don't know that they are eligible to participate in the process. Artists also need to know to submit their work to the Recording Academy for Grammy consideration, or have a label with a well-organized operation to take care of that for them.LVRN's Balogun credits the Recording Academy for taking ""steps to educate people more on the process behind the nominations."" ""They made a huge effort to bring more people in this year for meetings, let them know how things work,"" he adds. Both 6lack and D.R.A.M. had separate sit-downs with officials at the Recording Academy. Terrence ""Punch"" Henderson, co-president of the label Top Dawg Entertainment, which saw its artists Kendrick Lamar and SZA receive multiple nominations apiece, also felt more in the loop this year. ""We all have to understand how the system actually moves,"" he says. ""I learned a lot this year when we went in and sat down with [the Recording Academy] and they gave us a bunch of information [about the nomination and voting process].""In addition, the Recording Academy moved to an online voting system for the first time in 2018, a move that's likely to raise turnout among younger voters used to living in the digital age. (The accounting firm Deloitte, which oversees the voting process, doesn't share turnout data.) ""A paper ballot is tough,"" Balogun says. ""People don't even check their mail anymore"" – especially since the voting body includes musicians and producers, who travel frequently. Anokute didn't vote for last year's Grammys; he voted this year partially thanks to the ease of the online ballot. The new voting system also makes it easier to avoid mistakes, like casting a vote in too many categories (15 is the max, plus the four general categories), which nullifies your ballot.Another factor that surely improved the nomination process is the increasing dominance of streaming: It's never been easier to be a well-educated voter. A decade ago, a voter with a rock or country background voting on a general category may not have heard a hot rap single or a great R&amp;B album. In the world of Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube, voters have no excuse not to listen. ""Streaming helped to to quantify hip-hop and R&amp;B properly, so it's better represented,"" says Balogun. ""People see the impact on culture. In the past, people may have just voted for artists they had heard of. But maybe they did their research more this year -- If this song has 500 million streams, maybe I should check this out -- which is important for all of us.""&nbsp;In the second round of Grammy voting, the online ballot even has links to all the songs that are nominated to make it easier for voters to do their homework.Rap, R&amp;B and Latin pop music have fared particularly well in the streaming landscape, which has in turn been reflected in the Billboard charts, leading to news coverage and increased cultural awareness. ""That by its very nature is going to make this kind of selection process more in the moment, more in line with what is moving the fans,"" says Zane Lowe, creative director and L.A. host for Apple Music's Beats 1 radio. ""With streaming, you've seen hip-hop and R&amp;B become the most influential and successful genres of music, not just in terms of what they do for culture and the impact they've had in pop music, but also statistically."" Adds Anokute, ""You can't turn away from Cardi B, from Migos, from these acts that are cutting through. They got the popular vote.""Of course, winning the popular vote in America does not always mean you take home the big prize. And 2018 could turn out to be an outlier year, just like 2005, the only other year in Grammy history when four non-white acts were nominated for Album of the Year.&nbsp;But with artists from more genres and more age groups represented this year, from Balogun thinks a positive feedback loop will develop to help the Grammys' maintain this level of diversity moving forward. ""More people are going to feel like they're represented, which means more people will participate in the process,"" he says. ""And if more people participate, it will keep getting better."" &nbsp;"
8,David Browne,2017-11-30T16:59:00.000Z,"AC/DC's Malcolm Young: Bandmates, Admirers Remember Group's Quiet 'Catalyst'","malcolm young, malcolm young death, malcolm young ac/dc, malcolm young acdc, malcolm young biography, malcolm young rolling stone",Rolling Stone,"""I've never felt like a pop star,"" Malcolm Young told Rolling Stone in 2008. ""This is a 9-to-5 sort of gig."" Playing with AC/DC, the guitarist stood in the back, stone-faced, holding down the rhythm as his younger brother Angus soloed and stalked the stage in his trademark schoolboy outfit. When the Rolling Stones invited the Youngs onstage for a blues jam in 2003, Malcolm at first refused. ""He said, 'I can't,' "" former AC/DC singer Brian Johnson recalls. ""There was nothing funnier than Keith Richards and Ron Wood trying to drag him up there. He did a bit of a song with them and then walked back to the amps. That's just the way he was.""But Young, who died on November 18th at 64 of complications from dementia, was as integral to the band as his flamboyant brother. Malcolm co-wrote almost all of AC/DC's unrelenting anthems with Angus (and singer Johnson or his predecessor Bon Scott), kept a watchful eye on their image and integrity, and devised many landmark riffs. ""Angus was the star, but Malcolm was the most powerful and most underrated rhythm-guitar player in the history of rock &amp; roll, period,"" says Tom Morello. ""That band is uncompromised in its power, and the reason is Malcolm and the way he played. It's the tectonic plate on which the AC/DC world exists."" Malcolm dropped out of high school at 15 and began working as a mechanic after the Youngs relocated from Scotland to Australia. In the early Seventies, he joined a band called, strangely enough, the Velvet Underground – before he and Angus joined forces, first in the R&amp;B group the Marcus Hook Roll Band, and then the first version of AC/DC, in 1973. Although Angus would say that his brother could easily play lead solos, Malcolm preferred the role of rock-solid foundation, while serving as the band's driving force. As Angus told Rolling Stone in 2016, ""Malcolm was always one to battle through. He would look at me in times of crisis and go, 'We'll just go in and do some work ... write some songs.' He had that drive.""""Malcolm was the catalyst,"" says Johnson, recalling the writing sessions for his first album with the band, 1980's Back in Black, which sold 22 million copies to become the sixth-bestselling album in the U.S. of all time. ""He came to my room with a cassette and a legal pad and said, 'This is the rough music. Let's see what you can come up with.' I said, 'What's the title?' and he said, 'You Shook Me All Night Long.' I said, 'That's a fucking long title!' Malcolm gave rock &amp; roll a fist, a kick in the ass."" Johnson recalls watching Malcolm play ""Let There Be Rock"" as he went through two guitar picks just during that song. ""He was like a machine up there,"" says Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, who toured with AC/DC in their early days. ""He was totally serious, and he didn't make any mistakes. He was rock-steady.""Young's personal life could be less stable. In the late Eighties, his drinking got out of control. ""Malcolm had a problem,"" said his older brother George (who fronted the Marcus Hook Roll Band and passed away in October). ""In our family, if we have a problem, we deal with it ourselves."" Young got sober and, after missing a U.S. tour, returned to his rightful role. When Megadeth toured with AC/DC several years ago, Dave Mustaine glimpsed their less-than-crazy backstage life: ""Someone said, 'Can I get you a bottle of something?' and someone else said, 'All they do is drink tea and smoke cigarettes.' ""According to Johnson, Young's dementia began to reveal itself when AC/DC started rehearsing for the Black Ice tour in 2008 and Young had to relearn some of their old songs. By the time they started cutting 2014's Rock or Bust, he wasn't well enough to contribute. Later that year, he was admitted to a nursing home in Australia. ""It's hard to communicate,"" Angus said in 2016. ""I do pass on messages. I let him know there are a lot of people missing him."" Recalling the close of the Black Ice tour, Johnson says Malcolm was committed to the end: ""We were in Barcelona the last night – Malcolm still had a fire in his eyes you could spot a mile away. You couldn't take your eyes off him."""
9,Erik Hedegaard,2018-01-30T16:35:00.000Z,The Sound and the Fury of Meat Loaf: 'I Am Not a Rock Star',meat loaf,Rolling Stone,"As it turns out, in the hill country west of Austin, in a big-ass house in a big-ass gated community, the singer known as Meat Loaf is hanging in there. He's 70. His hair is thinning, his hands are unsteady, his back is such a mess he can't get into bed at night without help from Deborah, his wife of 10 years, much less put on his socks and shoes. To get to the easy chair he's sitting in now, he had to plod along using a real-old-duffer's walker. It all pretty much sucks. ""And because it hurts my back, I haven't been able to sing in a year,"" he says. ""You use everything to sing, and I just cannot do it.""He takes a swig of sparkling water, eases himself back in his chair and looks miserable. And miserable is not how you want Meat Loaf to look. You want him to look all fat and sweaty – great masses of hair flopping back and forth, eyeballs bulging right out of their sockets, voice soaring to hammy operatic heights – more or less just as he did back in 1977 with the release of his debut album, Bat Out of Hell (and its two greatest, most bombastic, over-the-top songs, ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light"" and ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad""), which went on to sell more than 40 million copies and is now marking its 40th glorious anniversary, despite most rock critics hating it (and this magazine calling it ""mannered and derivative,"" full of puerile comic-book ""pretensions""). That's how you want to see him. A born-to-lose Texas redneck who teamed up with a genius-type songwriter-producer named Jim Steinman and beat the odds to become a rock star, a fine bit-part movie actor and a temper-tantrum-thrower of some renown. So, it just doesn't seem right to see him here like this. It's a real bummer.Anyway, with singing and touring out of the question, what he mostly does these days is watch reruns of Blue Bloods and Law &amp; Order. Or he loses himself in an online role-playing game called Gladiator (""It stops my brain from thinking""). Or he starts detailing the particulars of his various surgeries (""Now, the first back surgery was to remove an arachnoid cyst, which looks like an alien in my spinal canal. . . .""). Or he kibitzes with people on his Facebook page, where if you tick him off, you better watch out, because he can spew with the best of them. ""Sorry you are so jaded, tired, bored, lacking enthusiasm, surfeited, sated, satiated, glutted, dulled, blunted, deadened, inured, tired, weary, wearied, unmoved, blasé, and apathetic,"" he recently wrote, in response to a critic. ""It is a shame that your life has led you down this road.""He also tends to get upset when anyone dares to say that his voice isn't what it once was, if they cite, for example, the 2016 show in Canada during which he passed out, back pain shooting through him ""like a sword,"" with him dropping the mic to the ground, after which his voice seemed to warble along on its own, disembodied, suggesting that he'd been lip-syncing.""Morons!"" he says. ""I'm going, 'Before you make a comment, learn something about music. Learn something about tone.' People saying, 'You can't sing anymore.' I mean, OK, I can't get up to the B's anymore, but I can still hit the high C's, and A is a really strong note, too."" He goes on, ""In my music, nothing is blues-based. Everyone else, their songs are an octave, an octave and a half, that's as high as they get."" He snorts, scoffs. ""Yeah, man, I'm at two and a half, sometimes three and a half. The main thing that's different now is the tone of my voice. They call it flat or out of key. It's not. It's just that my tone is completely different from what it was, and there's nothing I can do about it.""He pauses, takes a deep breath and says, ""Those Facebook people, man, you know, yeah, I get upset.""And that, in fact, is one of the great things about Loaf. He's always getting riled up about something, which was most infamously seen during his 2011 stint on Celebrity Apprentice, when he got into it with hapless Gary Busey over some purloined paints – they had been tasked with creating original art to be sold at a gallery – and went into an apoplectic rage, shouting, ""OK! Motherfucker! I bought those motherfucking paints!,"" a grand bit of theater that went on for a full five ratings-boosting minutes.""Well,"" he says today, somewhat sheepishly, ""I'm not an internal guy. You piss me off, you're gonna know it.""At the same time, he's a well-known softy who seems to spend half his days in tears. A girl gets kidnapped on some TV show, he cries. A record-company exec gives him a Babe Ruth autograph, he cries. Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, which was 16 years in the making, debuts at Number Three, he cries. Whitney Houston dies, he cries. His team wins on Celebrity Apprentice, he cries. He's an equal-opportunity weeper. ""Oh, I cry all the time,"" he says. ""I mean, I'll even cry about dog commercials. It's stupid.""It's not stupid, of course. It's just another side of the guy, just as there's the side that won't go to an upcoming premiere of the Bat Out of Hell stage musical if he has to use the walker (""Not a prayer""), and the side that doesn't want to go out, period. ""I don't have any business going out to where all the bars and bands are. They'd look at me and say, 'Who's the old guy? What's that old guy doing here?' No, man, I don't belong in those places.""So this is how Loaf lives today. This is what's become of him after 50 years in the rock &amp; roll business. But, in a sense, that's OK, because it's a miracle he got this far at all.As an actor,&nbsp;Loaf has appeared in 50-plus movies, starting with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975, as Eddie, the greasy biker), moving through Fight Club (1999, as Bob, a fatty known for his ""bitch tits""), thence to Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006, as Jack Black's dad), and along the way flinging himself into TV shows like Tales From the Crypt (1992), Monk (2009) and Glee (2010). He rarely stops to breathe. His albums have just kept piling up, 12 of them altogether since 1977, the best of them being the two Bat ones he made with Steinman. As a touring performer – larger-than-life, overwrought, stage-strutting, bellowing, raging, crooning, wearing puffy pirate shirts, ""a mesmerizing, wonderful presence,"" Steinman once said, ""his pupils would roll up in his head, and you'd see the whites of his eyes, and his hands would clutch, it was really powerful, he was extraordinary"" – he's gone on the road for decades at a time. He used to be indefatigable. You want him to play poker on Celebrity Blackjack, to hunt ghosts on Ghost Wars, to warble opposite Luciano Pavarotti, he's always been good to go. ""I've always had a target on my back,"" he likes to say, which maybe explains why, until recently, he's never slowed down. What else can a targeted guy like that do but keep running and, in his case, run fast, because what a big target he is and always has been.""Meat,"" he says, ""came about on the fourth day of me being alive."" This was in Dallas, when his dad, a cop, took one look at his newborn son and said, ""He looks like meat,"" and so Meat he became, nevermore his given name, Marvin. He weighed 185 in the fifth grade, 240 by the seventh. He was bullied about his weight constantly. ""Oh, man, I was tormented,"" he says.Life at home wasn't any better. His father was a violent alcoholic who would disappear for days at a time. He'd return and slap his boy around or throw him through a screen door, then vanish again, whereupon Meat and his mom, a schoolteacher, would hop in the car and go from bar to bar, trying to find him and bring him home again. Bad stuff.Even so, by high school he was beloved by his classmates for his mow-'em-down ways as a football player, and despite his size, he claims he never had a problem with the ladies. ""I had my first three-way in my mother's car in the fifth grade,"" he says, happily. ""OK, it was a make-out session with two girls, but that's still a threesome."" His eyes turn liquid. ""Cindy and Judy,"" he says.His mom, who sang in a gospel quartet, used to say to him, ""Good thing you're not going to be a singer, because you can't carry a tune in a bucket."" That's how Loaf remembers it, anyway. But he claims that all changed in his sophomore year, out on an athletic field, when a 12-pound shot put sailed 62 feet through the air and hit him in the head; after that, just like that, while trying out for choir, he discovered he suddenly had a three-and-a-half-octave vocal range. His mother died of cancer in 1966, when Loaf was 19. Shortly after the funeral, his father, drunk and bereft, kicked open his bedroom door and came at him with a butcher knife, for reasons unknown. ""I rolled off the bed just as he put that knife right in the mattress,"" he says. ""I fought for my life. Apparently I broke three ribs and his nose, and left the house barefoot in a pair of gym shorts and a T-shirt."" He never went home again and, in 1967, moved to L.A., started acting, started singing in bands, was John Belushi's understudy in a Broadway production of the National Lampoon Show, which was where he met Ellen Foley, the actress-singer with the cracked-velvet voice who is the recipient of his love and lust in the 1977 hit ""Paradise."" ""Growing up in a bumfuck Texas town, he might have become a serial killer or the guy who shot up the local 7-Eleven,"" Foley says. ""But the first time I saw him, he walked in with this incredible bravado and confidence, like in his mind he was already fully formed. He had this will that allowed him to do what he had to do to survive and exorcise a lot of his demons, through music. But there's a lot of sadness and anger, which is pretty much at the core of what he does.""He met Steinman while auditioning for a play. The two began working on Bat in 1972, finished a demo (with the help of Todd Rundgren) in 1975, and spent the next two years being rejected by every record label in the land, before someone took a chance and probably regretted it until March 1978, when Loaf appeared on Saturday Night Live and the album finally took off, propelled by a half-sappy, moon-pie Springsteen-on-acid-and-a-sugar-high-rush theatricality that'd never really been seen before and that blew right through the melancholy confines of the then-dominant punk scene.A year later, without telling Loaf, Steinman holed up somewhere in New Jersey with Bruce Springsteen keyboardist Roy Bittan to work on a Bat follow-up. ""And that pissed me off,"" Loaf says. ""I'm going, 'No. That's wrong,' because Jim and I did everything together on Bat Out of Hell, and we need to do everything together. Roy Bittan. When I found out, I thought I was going to kill myself, and I think I had already tried, but I don't remember it. What happened next is, I basically had a nervous breakdown.""""From how I grew up, that's where I learned to be tough and to never stop. I mean, I'm tough as nails. ... Nothing, nothing has ever put me down. ... I never go down.""For the next few years, in fact, Loaf regressed into a pre-shot-put-to-the-noggin state and couldn't sing. He'd open his mouth and, as Steinman once said, ""he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist . . . like a dragon trying to sing. It was a horrifying sound."" It took daily visits to a shrink for six months for him to get his voice back. After that, he released solo records that went nowhere, got into various big-money lawsuits with Steinman, finally patched things up with him, and together they staged one of the most startling comebacks in rock history with 1993's Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell and the single ""I'd Do Anything for Love.""""From how I grew up,"" Loaf says, ""that's where I learned to be tough and to never stop. I mean, I'm tough as nails. Once I was hit in the head with a pool cue and just turned to the guy and said, 'You just made a big mistake.' Got hit in the head with a whiskey bottle. Had my head slammed into a locker. I've had 18 concussions. And nothing, nothing has ever put me down. Yeah, man,"" he says, ""I never go down.""The day is getting short, the light turning brittle, and Loaf has been sitting for far too long. ""I've got to get up and walk,"" he says, rising to his feet. ""My back is driving me crazy. But then I'm probably a little crazy anyway, because of all the concussions."" He gets behind the walker and shuffles forth, down a hallway past wife Deborah in the kitchen.Along the way, he enumerates who he's voted for: McGovern, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Obama the first term but not the second. As for Trump, whom he met several times while filming Celebrity Apprentice, he's been reluctant to talk about him. It's the same today. ""I'm not gonna tell ya,"" he says, mulishly, when asked who he voted for in 2016.But if you shout at him loud enough, maybe moan something like, ""Oh, come on!"" he'll once again demur, only to shrug, lower his voice and say, ""I voted for Trump."" But that's all he says. He doesn't say why or how he feels about him now, which just about says it all regardless.He presses forward, going deeper into the past. He's got all this history, all these stories. There's the time he gave Springsteen advice about how to make a music video. ""I said, 'You just can't let your eyes go dead. When you're lip-syncing, just repeat the words with your eyes and they won't go dead.' That's working-the-camera 101. I told Billy Joel the same thing."" There's the time he sat next to John Lennon in a diner and the only thing he could think to say was, ""Pass the Sweet'N Low."" Then he returns to Springsteen. ""You know, your magazine started this thing where we stole everything for Bat Out of Hell from Springsteen and it was nothing but a rehash of Born to Run."" He shakes his head. ""I'm saying to myself, 'Where does Springsteen have a 'Two Out of Three'? Where does he have a 'Paradise'?' The only thing that is close to Springsteen is the first verse from 'Bat,' and Steinman wrote that verse before Born to Run was released.""""Look, I am a sex god.&nbsp;But I am not a rock star. ...&nbsp;I don't pretend to be [a legend]. I want to be just a normal human being.""He's back at his chair again, looking down, figuring the angles to get himself seated. He doesn't know whether he'll ever make another record, doesn't know if he'll ever tour again. It's all dependent on the vagaries of his health. And Steinman, who rarely speaks to the press, seems to be in the same boat. ""He doesn't want me talking about his health, but I'm worried about him,"" says Loaf. He adds, ""You know, my dream was never to be a rock &amp; roll star. I wanted to play professional football. I've never wanted to be a rock &amp; roll star.""""Oh, tell the truth,"" says Deborah from the kitchen. ""You sex god, you.""Loaf smiles. ""Look. I am a sex god. But I am not a rock star. When people call me a legend, I say, 'Don't call me that, I'm not a legend.' I don't pretend to be one. I want to be just a normal human being.""



































































But, of course, he's never been normal. Normal would
have died the second the 12-pound shot put landed on his skull. He's Meat Loaf,
the guy who right now says, ""I'm not done unless you are."" Which
seems to be just about right."
