0,Maura Johnston,2017-10-26T20:44:00.000Z,"Kelly Clarkson: 'I Am a Whole Lot of Woman, and That's OK'","kelly clarkson, interviews, fall album preview, new releases, kelly clarkson meaning of life, kelly clarkson new album, kelly clarkson songs, kelly clarkson discography, when does kelly clarkson album come out, kelly clarkson weight",Rolling Stone,"Kelly Clarkson is in a car on the way to a video shoot, speeding through New York as the summer wanes, picking out billboards and other sights. ""I'm looking at a freakin' ship right now,"" exclaims Clarkson as her car passes the permanently docked ship that houses the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum. ""This scenery is crazy â€“ fighter jets, what?"" Clarkson has a seemingly boundless energy to go with her rich, octave-leaping voice, and that combination has made her one of pop's most compelling live draws â€“ her concerts feature hits from her wide-ranging catalog like the slinky kiss-off ""Walk Away"" and the resilient ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),"" as well as covers that show off her breadth, borrowing from Prince and Rihanna as well as Paramore and Radiohead. (There's also a lot of fun banter.) Her eighth studio album,&nbsp;Meaning of Life is the first in Clarkson's catalog to have the electric atmosphere of her concerts â€“ she's singing with renewed bravura on songs like the urgent lead single ""Love So Soft"" and the sultry ""Didn't I""; arrangements on tracks like the manifesto-with-soul ""Whole Lotta Woman"" swing and bounce; and stray studio asides offer glimpses at her bubbly personality.""It was essential â€“ at least for me â€“ to make a record that almost sounded like [my live show],"" Clarkson tells Rolling Stone. ""When people come see me live, we've brought horns out, we've got strings out. People don't come for the costume changes!""Meaning of Life is Clarkson's first LP on Atlantic Records; her last record, 2015's Piece By Piece, closed out the contract with RCA Records she won after emerging victorious from the inaugural 2002 season of the imminently returning&nbsp;American Idol. Even though Clarkson, who's been living in Nashville for the past decade, has been a consistent pop presence since her Idol win, touring widely and releasing pop-radio staples, her tussles with her label over the years, which included clashes with executives like former RCA bigwig Clive Davis and pressure to work with producer Lukasz ""Dr. Luke"" Gottwald, took a toll on the singer.""I really almost quit like three times,"" she recalls. ""I was just like, 'You know, there's a lot of sacrifice going on here, and not a lot of happiness.' That doesn't make it worth it as a human â€“ forget being an artist or anything else.""But at Atlantic, Clarkson has found a home that, she says, understands her better both as a person and as an artist. Craig Kallman, Atlantic Records' CEO, helped steer Clarkson's new record â€“ ""instrumental,"" she says when asked to describe his input â€“ while also allowing her to explore the soulful side of her voice that she displayed on Idol and in concert. ""It wasn't a test by any means, but I was curious [about his answer to the question]: 'If you were going to make a record with Kelly Clarkson, what would it sound like? What's your dream scenario?'"" she says of an early meeting with Kallman and Atlantic COO Julie Greenwald. Kallman reached into Atlantic's storied archives for his answer: ""He, right off the bat, referenced Aretha Franklin. He said, 'I like all your music, and obviously people love you. But I feel like no one's ever heard the record that maybe you could make soulfully.' He kept referencing Aretha â€“ 'You know, she really had her dreams take off, and I feel like that's you. I really want to create that for you.' ""I was like, either he's a really good salesman and full of shit, or honest and the most amazing human to work with,"" she laughs. ""It's the latter.""The title track, a showy ballad where Clarkson flaunts her impressive range, had been laying in wait since the Piece By Piece sessions, and it gave Clarkson the opportunity to signal her new direction to potential collaborators. ""A lot of people kept sending 'Since U Been Gone 2.0,' and [songs that resembled earlier hits] 'Stronger' and 'My Life Would Suck Without You,'"" she says. ""I was like, 'I really need to guide people in the direction that we're going.' [Meaning of Life] doesn't really sound like anything on the radio.""Kallman, who's credited as the album's co-executive producer alongside Clarkson, also helped the album's feel stay consistent. ""You always see people on albums [credited as] 'executive producer' and you're like, 'What does that mean?' But Craig, he showed me. He has worked probably harder than any producer, engineer, vocalist, writer on this album â€“ it's a project he really was excited to work on, and you could tell. It was just such a blessing. Craig would push these producers that are so used to working with other executives â€“ making [their songs] sound so radio-friendly, but tearing the spirit and soul out sometimes,"" Clarkson raves. ""He would say, 'No, no, wait. We wanted you because we knew you were capable of this, so give us this.' He got Earth, Wind and Fire to play on ['Love So Soft'],, and 'Whole Lotta Woman.' It was amazing to work with a record executive that was gung ho about having that live, organic [feel].""""Whole Lotta Woman"" is one of the album's standout tracks, a fiery ode to being ""too much"" that features Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's Verdine White on bass as well as the storied funk band's horn section. The music recalls classic soul anthems like ""Respect"" while also having the pop of Janet Jackson's Rhythm NationÂ_-era output like ""Black Cat."" ""I met ['Lotta' writers and producers Novawav, made up of Denisia 'Blu June' Andrews and Brittany 'Chi' Coney] in LA, and we had talked for, I don't know, an hour, or more, because I talk a lot,"" she laughs. ""It was really fun to talk to them about how it took me awhile to fall in love because I am a whole lot of woman â€“ I have a big personality, I'm a grown-ass woman that can pay her bills, and I make a lot of money. That's intimidating."" The conversation also encompassed the way women's looks get picked over by people in the industry. ""One of my favorite singers on the planet, Aretha Franklin, isn't tiny. But she's boss, and when she walks onto the stage everyone stops breathing. We're marveling at her talent, [but] maybe some artists that we loved growing up would never make it today because of that dumb reason. Why we are afraid of it? People come in different packages, and they may not all be what you like, but man, don't they sound good?""As a female pop star, Clarkson's appearance has been a topic of discussion among observers for years. ""I never wanted to draw attention, ""she says. ""But for 15 years of my life, no matter if I'm really thin or really not, [weight was] always a talk of discussion. Even when I was on Idol, it was a discussion. I never really wanted to attract attention, because then you talk about it all the time, instead of [your] music. So it was fun to write a song that said, 'Yeah, you're right, I am a whole lot of woman, and it's ok. I came with a brain, and I came with drive and passion and sensuality, and these things that are awesome. If you can't handle it, that's totally cool, but you're not tall enough to ride this ride, then move along. It's fine.' We put a fun twist on it."" While producers and writers who have worked with Clarkson in the past, like Jesse Shatkin (Sia, Fitz and the Tantrums) and Greg Kurstin (Beck, Tegan and Sara), appear on the album, new collaborators, like the R&amp;B singer-songwriter HarlÅ“ (Britney Spears, MKTO), producer Nick Ruth (Nick Jonas, Carly Rae Jepsen) and producer Mick Schultz (Jeremih), invigorated the process. ""Mick Schultz has this super-fresh take on Nineties music that I love,"" says Clarkson. ""I was floored by him. He and [HarlÅ“, real name Jessica Karpov] worked a lot together. She's ridiculous. I was like, 'Thank you for giving me Jessica,"" because her vocals are insane, and she's a really rad human, as well."" ""Medicine,"" which HarlÅ“ and Schultz co-wrote, is a jittery R&amp;B-pop song with a slinky bassline that Clarkson uses as a springboard for her barnburning vocal; ""Heat,"" another collaboration involving the pair, spins out of frantic handclapping, with Clarkson and her background vocalists engaging in a feisty back-and-forth. It recalls the upbeat soul-tinged hits of the Nineties while possessing a decidedly 21st-century energy. ""[Mick] had this amazing way to reference Nineties music, in a way that it wasn't all Mariah Carey and Whitney, or Duran Duran â€“ it was just an amazing way of putting it all together in a song,"" Clarkson says.&nbsp;Even though it represents a large swath of what's made her so appealing to so many listeners for the past decade and a half, Meaning of Life signals the beginning of a new chapter for Clarkson, one where the inaugural&nbsp;American Idol enters a new period of making music on her own terms â€“ and being aware that she's now in a position to do so in an even better way. ""In fairness to everybody who I've worked with in the past, if you would have given me these same songs at the age of 19 or 20, it wouldn't have sounded like this,"" says Clarkson. ""You have to live and have experiences in order to have what comes with a lot of these songs â€“ you can't just not have had circumstances where you've had to be bold and confident. You have to have that in life in order to sing it.""And now she's ready to raise her voice and revel in a collaborative relationship with her new label. ""It was really just an incredible experience,"" she says. ""Everyone just wanted to make great music, and I know that sounds super cheesy, but I really feel like I deserve that at this point, and it was really just a blessing all the way around.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Jonathan Bernstein,2017-11-06T14:24:00.000Z,Inside Mavis Staples and Jeff Tweedy's New Trump-Era Protest LP,"mavis staples, jeff tweedy, staple singers, staples singers, mavis staples jeff tweedy, mavis staples if all i was was black, mavis staples interview, jeff tweedy interview, wilco",Rolling Stone,"Mavis Staples was just eight years old when, one evening in 1948, her father, Roebuck ""Pops"" Staples, sat her and her siblings down on the floor of their South Side Chicago apartment, and taught them their first-ever song: the country-gospel traditional ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken."" Seventy years later, and little more than 10 miles north of that same childhood home, Mavis Staples was in Jeff Tweedy's loft recording studio listening to some new songs he had written when Tweedy began strumming a plaintive folk number called ""Peaceful Dream."" As soon as he began to play the song, Staples was immediately reminded of her first experience as a singer. ""Lord, Tweedy, that song sounds so much like my family,"" Staples told the Wilco singer. ""It sounds like the Staple Singers, it does.""Tweedy was overjoyed; that's exactly what he had intended. ""Mavis,"" he responded, ""I'm even playing a couple of Pops' guitar licks in there.""""You ain't telling me nothing!"" joked Staples. ""I can hear my father."" ""Peaceful Dream"" forms the backbone of Staples' latest album, If All I Was Was Black, her third collaboration with Tweedy since 2010. It is the latest release in an incredibly prolific period of work from Staples, during which she has toured nearly constantly, appeared at several high-profile tribute concerts in her honor, and found time to team up with M. Ward for her rootsy 2016 record Livin' on a High Note. But unlike her first two cheery, largely apolitical records with Tweedy, including their Grammy-winning 2010 collaborative debut You Are Not Alone, Staples' new album â€“ out November 17th â€“ is a pointed piece of social commentary that directly recalls the social-justice anthems Mavis once sang with the Staple Singers alongside Dr. Martin Luther King in the Sixties. ""So many young boys are being stopped by the police and being killed. We've got a man in the White House that is urging this stuff on, and he's brought on a rebirth of bigotry and hate,"" says Staples. ""This world ... I just don't know. I just stop myself and wonder, 'What is going on?' I've been doing some extra praying. We need it. We need it bad.""""Mavis was really surprisingly OK with sounding angry,"" Tweedy says of their new album. ""It's the first time since we started working together where there's been a righteous anger that she's been comfortable with.""Singing the types of songs the Staple Singers had popularized in the Sixties has gotten Staples in a particularly reflective mood as of late. ""I still talk to Pops,"" she says of her father, who passed away in 2000. ""I'll say, 'I know you hear this song.'"" Staples continues her lifelong project of singing protest songs of both uplift and struggle on new originals like ""Try Harder,"" ""Build a Bridge,"" and ""No Time for Crying,"" the latter a moving call to action: ""People are dying, bullets are flying,"" Staples sings with quivering urgency, ""We've got work to do, so much work to do.""""The more I get to sing a song like 'No Time For Crying,' the harder I'm going to sing it,"" says Staples, 78. ""That's the only way I know to get to the people, is through a song. I've lived the life I've sang about and I just want to make it better. Music is powerful. Music is power. It can bring us all together as a people, and that's what I hope to do.""The songs on If All I Was Was Black began to take shape as Staples and Tweedy observed continued police violence against African-Americans during the past few years. Watching coverage of the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville this past August, Staples was reminded of the racial hatred her family had fought so hard to overcome in the Sixties. ""When I saw those men marching with those torches, the next day I was looking for them to burn a cross,"" she says. ""They didn't have the white sheets on, but that was who they were.""""Mavis and I talked about how sadly, the time isn't right to put out another happy, feel-good record,"" Tweedy explains. ""It's time to remind people that the songs that she sings from the time with her father and the Staple Singers, back when they were embedded in the civil-rights movement, those songs aren't nostalgic. I think people can sometimes take them that way when she does her shows. I thought it would be great if we could make a record that was all about now and that really hammered home the point that this is not a struggle that's over. In a lot of ways it's not a struggle that we've even begun the types of conversations that we need to have."" ""I've never taken 'Freedom Highway' out of my set, because I knew we weren't finished, my work wasn't finished,"" says Staples. ""But I never thought I'd have to go this far."" ""Jeff Tweedy and I knew we had to get back together,"" she continues. ""I had to get back to the master, back to the downright poet. Me and Jeff Tweedy, we've been there, I more so than Tweedy has, and we know what we're talking about, we know what needs to be heard.""The songs on If All I Was Was Black were written after a longstanding series of extended conversations between Staples and Tweedy about the direction the country had taken in recent years. Although Tweedy wrote the majority of the songs on the record, he is quick to credit the thematic and lyrical contributions of Staples, who helped write several songs, and more generally, provided the foundational ideas and spiritual ethos of If All I Was Was Black.""There isn't anything I can point to that would reflect a traditional songwriting scenario where people are sitting down and one person says a line and then another says a line,"" Tweedy says. ""I wanted the songwriting credits to reflect that I was writing through and with Mavis' voice. Having conversations with Mavis about civil rights and the current state of affairs really gave me a clearer voice to write with to address those things. In the past, we've mostly just had a great time being in each other's presence while still acknowledging the legacy and heritage of her and her family, so it was interesting to actually highlight our color in our discussions this time.""For Tweedy, writing for Mavis' voice provided the longtime Wilco frontman with a way to straightforwardly address his feelings about the state of his country in a way that he might not otherwise have been able to access. ""There are a lot of things on this record that would be much more difficult to say in my own material,"" he says. ""Mavis' voice has allowed me to approach things that way, just coming out and saying things directly. I think whoever listens to my own music would be a bit mystified by that directness in say, Wilco. But these are definitely things that have really, really, really upset me about our culture, about the country we live in, about my friendships with people of color, with my community, all of these things affect me on a daily basis. I'm honored to be given a place to have an outlet for that frustration and to be a part of that conversation.""One song that Staples specifically played a large part in writing was the title track. In its earliest stage, Tweedy was hesitant about even singing the song himself, asking Staples if she thought it was OK for him to show her an early version of the song. ""There's a demo version of me singing 'If All I Was Was Black,'"" Tweedy says with nervous laughter. ""I don't know if that should ever see the light of day."" ""When Jeff came up with 'If All I Was Was Black,' that cracked me up,"" says Staples. When her record label was testing out various ideas for the album cover, Mavis Staples insisted on a stark, side-profile photograph of the singer that covered most of her face in dark shadows. ""They were trying out some different ideas and I said no, 'Just put me on the cover, black as I can be,'"" she says. ""It's beautiful.""Staples was inspired to record her new album, in part, by a recent slew of young singers she's seen carry on her tradition of socially minded freedom songs. In the past year alone, Rhiannon Giddens named her most recent album Freedom Highway (and covered the Staple Singer original), while artists like Gorillaz and Benjamin Booker have enlisted Staples to sing on 2017 anthems like ""Let Me Out"" and ""Witness."" When Staples first heard the latter, written by Booker, she thought, ""Lord, thank you Jesus, we got some help. Me and Tweedy got some help."" ""This spirit won't die,"" says Staples. ""When my manager first sent me Rhiannon's record, I just cried. I said, 'Well, thank you, Jesus, it's carrying on. This spirit won't die. Rhiannon's a young lady and who knows, maybe some other young people might join her. I'd be grateful if they did."" For now, however, Mavis Staples is more than happy to carry the spirit of her own legacy herself, in song and onstage. ""I'm not worried,"" she says. ""Like Dr. King said, I know we will see the promised land one day, but what we have to get through to get there, we shouldn't be going through this right now. We're going backwards. But that song, 'No Time For Crying,' that says it all. We've got to roll our sleeves up, put our grown-man pants on and grown-lady pants on, and get to work. We've got to get to work.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Simon Vozick-Levinson,2017-12-29T17:38:00.000Z,How Bob Dylan Crafted a Minimal New Sound on 'John Wesley Harding',"bob dylan, bob dylan rolling stone, bob dylan john wesley harding, john wesley harding album, john wesley harding, bob dylan the band",Rolling Stone,"In the autumn of 1967, Bob Dylan took a mysterious trip to Nashville. ""As I recall, it was just on a kind of whim that Bob went down,"" Robbie Robertson, who had spent much of that summer wood shedding with Dylan and the rest of the Band in upstate New York, would later say. To this day, no one knows for sure when Dylan wrote many of the 12 songs he recorded on his secretive visit. He hadn't played a single one of them during his mythic sessions in the basement of ""Big Pink"" near Woodstock that year, and he reputedly composed several of the best new tunes (""The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,"" ""I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine"" and ""Drifter's Escape"") during his two-day train ride from New York to Nashville. Once there, he knocked out his eighth album in just three sessions in a local studio. ""We did the whole thing in nine, nine and a half hours,"" says Charlie McCoy, who returned from the Blonde on Blonde sessions to play bass on the new material. ""He was focused. And he never used a lyric sheet. To memorize those lyrics, with all those double meanings, was impressive.""John Wesley Harding came as a shock to fans, and decades later, it stands alone in Dylan's discography â€“ a hard pivot away from the revolutionary rock &amp; roll masterpieces that preceded it, and equally distant from anything else he'd done or would do. Its tightly crafted country-folk songs lack traditional choruses but teem with cryptic tales and strange warnings. ""There was to be no wasted language, no wasted breath,"" Allen Ginsberg later said of the approach to songwriting that Dylan adopted after Blonde on Blonde. ""All the imagery was to be functional rather than ornamental."" Dylan himself traced the change to his 1966 motorcycle crash: ""I thought I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before,"" he recalled in 1969. ""But I couldn't do it anymore.""Dylan began incorporating explicit religious language into his lyrics; much has been made of Beatty Zimmerman's report around this time that her son kept ""a huge Bible open on a stand in the middle of his study."" The death of Dylan's early idol Woody Guthrie, on October 3rd, 1967, less than a month before recording began, may well have influenced songs like ""I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine"" (a surreal riff on the labor-rally folk standard ""Joe Hill""). The sound of the album was bracingly austere, which Dylan later explained as a reaction to the ""very indulgent"" psychedelic orchestration of albums like the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Casting aside his own ambitious arrangements on the previous year's Blonde on Blonde, he called back only two of his sidemen from that album â€“ McCoy on bass and Kenny Buttrey on drums â€“ and kept his interactions with them at a bare minimum. ""He didn't talk to us, which was unusual,"" McCoy says. ""Just did not communicate. I think he appreciated what we were doing. It was hard to tell.""It was a stark shift away from the late-night carnivalatmosphere of the Blonde on Blonde sessions â€“ but as the songs made clear,that Dylan was long gone.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Elias Leight,2018-02-21T21:39:00.000Z,Producer Boi-1da on the Road to Drake's Number One Smash 'God's Plan',"Boi-1da, Boi-1da Drake, Drake, Drake God's Plan, Drake producer Boi-1da",Rolling Stone,"Boi-1da has been a crucial part of&nbsp;Drake's braintrust ever since he helped craft the rapper's first hit, 2009's ""Best I Ever Had."" In 2014, Boi-1da co-produced ""0 to 100,"" the first SoundCloud loosie to garner a Grammy nomination; in 2015, he oversaw Drake's turn towards belligerent and brawling as executive producer on If You're Reading This It's too Late; in 2016, he soothed Drake's transition into dancehall, producing the Number One Rihanna collaboration ""Work"" as well as Views' ""Controlla.""Boi-1da managed to one-up himself in January, when another song he co-produced, ""God's Plan,"" debuted at Number One on the Hot 100. It's Drake's second Number One hit, but the first to debut at the top of the chart, where it has sat comfortably for four consecutive weeks, shattering several streaming records. And Drake is just one artist Boi-1da works with. He's also produced showstoppers for Kanye West (""Real Friends"") and Kendrick Lamar (""The Blacker the Berry""); last year he appeared on releases as disparate as Lana Del Rey's Lust for Life, G-Eazy's The Beautiful &amp; Damned and Romeo Santos' Golden.&nbsp;Rolling Stone caught up with Boi-1da to talk about his path into production, meeting Drake, his longtime love of dancehall and the success of ""God's Plan.""&nbsp;When did you first start making music?When I was 15 years old. I was told by a friend about the program that I use to this day, FruityLoops. One summer I was really bored, and I ended up taking my mom's credit card and downloading it. I started to work on it from there and it kind of became an addiction. I just kept playing around with it until I got really, really good at it. I entered a beat-maker's competition and ended up winning it a few years in a row.You hadn't done any music-making before FruityLoops?Yeah, I didn't do music at all. My mom had bought me a Casio keyboard when I was younger, but I wasn't really into it. I didn't go to piano lessons; I didn't know anything formal.Did you listen to a lot of music?My parents were big listeners as well as my sister. So I was always in a house with music playing 24/7. My dad used to play a lot of dancehall music, so that's what I was into really early.When you took up Fruity Loops, were your friends into it as well, or was it just your thing?I really started off myself just toying around with the program. Turning knobs and seeing what they do on my own. At the time there was no YouTube to look up tutorials. It was really about figuring it out.A lot of producers start on one program but then move to others&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;why did you stick to FruityLoops?I thought it was the easiest and most comfortable for me to use. It's easy to get your ideas out, your ideas across. The concept is basic. I'm the kind of guy, I don't like to sit there and waste hours trying to make a song. If it doesn't come out when it comes out, you're forcing it.When did you decide you were ready to enter Battle of the Beatmakers?I had really honest friends around me. I would play music for some of my friends in high school and they would be like, This is trash. They'd tell me straight up if it was garbage. Eventually it got to a point where they were like, this is starting to sound good. But I still didn't think I was ready for the competition â€“ I entered it and I was terrified; I was the youngest person in the competition. I didn't go in there with an expectation of winning. The competition was like, you come in with your best beats, and it's your best beat against the other person's best beat. There's three judges and a crowd, so the crowd reaction on top of the judges' scorecards determine if you move on to the next round. Once you use a beat, it's over, you can't use that beat again. So you have to plan it out.You were making dancehall at this point or hip-hop focused?I was really hip-hop focused. After my whole dancehall era, I fell in love with hip-hop. That was my thing.And how many years in a row did you win the competition?Three years in a row. Almost four â€“ I made it to the finals for the fourth one. It was going to be my fourth and my last one, but I think they got tired of seeing me one.Did that event raise your profile locally?I started meeting a lot of people when I first went to that event. I ended up meeting guys like Saukrates, one of the first rappers out of Toronto to represent where we're from, and I ended up meeting a producer by the name of D10 that I ended up working with a lot. He was actually the one who introduced me to Drake. I met a lot of key people that I'm very close with today through those competitions.What was your first official placement?Kardinal Offishall's album Not 4 Sale. I ended up doing four songs on that album. I was 18, 19 â€“ I was really excited to be a part of anything.How did you eventually meet Drake?I was working with D10, an amazing keyboard player and producer. He would always talk about his friend Drake and how good he was. I never really paid attention to it until he was like I'm gonna hook you and Drake up; I think you should guys make music. We ended up meeting up and the chemistry was there from the jump. I understand the vision, where he wanted to go. From the jump, I was like, this guy is going to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.So his talent was already apparent?Um-hmm. Everything was pretty local back then. Locally, he was exceptional, better than everybody.What was the Toronto scene like at that time?When I was coming up it was very gangsta hip-hop dominated. We have Glenn Lewis, we had Kardinal, but at the time 50 Cent was like the biggest artist. Hearing Drake's music and seeing that it could stand up next to someone like 50 Cent and he's not even being gangster was pretty dope. It was really relatable, especially to somebody like me â€“ I'm not a gangster.Was production your full-time gig then?No. At the time I was working at Winners, a retail clothing store. I was working factory jobs. I would go to work then spend all night doing music, go to the studio, go to work in the morning. At a point I was like, I need to quit because this job is draining my creative energy. I would get all these ideas for beats and songs in my head at work, but by the time I got home, I was too tired to do anything. So I got tired of that. I took a chance on myself.""Best I Ever Had"" was your first big hit; did you feel like that was going to be a big record?I liked that beat a lot. But I didn't think it was going to be part of a hit record. It wasn't the best thing I've ever done. But after hearing what Drake did it, I knew that a lot of people would like it. But becoming a worldwide hit, we could have never called that.Did you start getting more calls overnight?The phones started ringing off the hook. Publishers start calling. I was on MySpace at that time, a lot of artists hit me up to get tracks that sound like ""Best I Ever Had."" I hate that â€“ I already made ""Best I Ever Had.""A lot of producers, once they have a hit, try to work with as many different people as possible. But for most of your career, you've kept your circle pretty small.I enjoy working with Drake. He's my favorite artist to work with. We have crazy chemistry when we work. My motto is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I've always stuck with the game plan. I've worked with other artists as well, but Drake has always been my main focus. He's the greatest to me.It's been almost a decade now that you've been making hits, and mainstream hip-hop has changed so much during that period&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;how do you adjust?Keeping my mind open, not sheltering myself musically. I want to get in with a lot of people, and I listen a lot â€“ to what's new, to what people gravitate towards. Even if I don't agree with it, I keep listening until I figure out why people like it.Was there anything recently that puzzled you at first but you eventually figured it out?I'm not gonna call anybody out. But when you're introduced to something brand new, sometimes you just don't know what's going on. For instance, the first time I heard 808s &amp; Heartbreak by Kanye, I didn't get it. I listened to it a year after, and I was like, this is completely genius. Sometimes things don't register immediately. Now it's one of my favorite albums â€“ to this day I listen to songs from it every single day. Still. But I was a year late on it.It's interesting you mention that album: A lot of people talk about Drake's early sound relative to that record, but around If You're Reading This It's Too Late, he shifted towards something fiercer, and you're often credited with helping that transition.Drake gave me the opportunity to executive produce that album with him. I love hearing Drake spaz out and just rap â€“ I feel like he's the best when he does that. Just the best. It was a time when we wanted to make a lot of energetic music, and that's what we did â€“ we locked in, and it was all energy.On the other end of the spectrum, you're also credited with boosting dancehall in the mainstream. How did you make it back towards that sound which you loved when you were younger?That was such an early influence, my first love musically. I didn't know anything else outside of dancehall when I came to Canada. My dad would only listen to dancehall and reggae. That was the only thing I knew about. My family and I would huddle in front of the radio every Friday to listen to 88.1 'cause that was the only time in Toronto they played reggae and dancehall on the radio. I'm Jamaican; dancehall is basically in my blood.At that time, there was a lot of trap music going on. I had a discussion with my friends â€“ I really want to make something different. I missed how dancehall used to make people react. It would make girls want to dance. I tried to bring that whole feel back, and then people like it. It was another thing where it was like, this might work; it might not. But I just wanted to do something that made me feel a certain way when I was a kid. Maybe it will make someone else feel how I felt. I didn't know it would pop off like that. But when I heard [Rihanna's] ""Work"" and [Drake's] ""Controlla,"" I was like, this is gonna work. And they did work.In the last year, you got more into the pop radio lane&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;a Lana Del Rey credit, a G-Eazy credit. What's it like working in that space vs. rap?That was dope. Working with Lana, I really got to step outside of my comfort zone. I learned a lot about different structures with songs. We're going to continue to work. We also have great chemistry and the songs just flow together. It was a great experience to work with somebody outside of hip-hop. Then I brought my world into her world and vice versa. It was a nice little blend. We made that record from scratch, started from nothing. We began with a piano and her signing and it turned into ""Summer Bummer.""Obviously ""God's Plan"" is your latest hit&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;how did that beat come together?Drake had that halfway finished already. I just came in and added to it. The record started with him and [producer] Cardo. I came in and changed the whole bounce to it. I can't take credit for the whole record â€“ it really started with Cardo. It came together pretty well.You were credited on both ""God's Plan"" and ""Diplomatic Immunity""&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;is it ever difficult when one of your records outshines the other?They got attention on different levels. ""God's Plan"" is a massive, catchy, radio-friendly song that can easily be played in the club. ""Diplomatic Immunity"" was a record where Drake got a lot off his chest. That's a statement. People love ""Diplomatic Immunity"" â€“ some people love it just as much or even more than ""God's Plan."" I'm never mad that one record does better than another because they're done for different purposes. The purpose of ""Diplomatic Immunity"" was to feed the hardcore rap audience. ""God's Plan"" was to feed everybody.Has your relationship with Drake evolved over the decade plus you guys have been working together?We've both grown musically. But we're always on the same page â€“ we're always ready.What is next for you in the coming year?This year I'll be putting out a compilation album with a lot of the different artists I work with. And other than focusing on working with Drake, I've been working with Joyner Lucas, the first artist I ever signed. We're working on his debut project; he's another amazing talent â€“ a spectacular rapper and visionary director. I believe that his project is going to be well-received.What led you to start signing acts and putting out your own project?It's time to start doing stuff for myself. I always felt like I wanted to. Now it's the right time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Corbin Reiff,2018-01-30T17:29:00.000Z,Inside Car Seat Headrest's New-Old 'Fantasy',car seat headrest,Rolling Stone,"It's a small room. More of a closet really. Toward the back, there's an upright piano; on the left, a large Marshall guitar amplifier, a box of Pop-Tarts and an electric heater. On the floor, a backpack and a flimsy mattress where Car Seat Headrest mastermind Will Toledo has been sleeping for the past two weeks.For all intents and purposes, this is home: Decade Music Studios, on the fourth floor of a nondescript commercial building on the North Side of Chicago. Back in the place that he currently says is home, Seattle, Toledo has been living out of a suitcase while staying in different Airbnb spaces because the house he was living in was recently sold. His hometown of Leesburg, Virginia â€“ a quaint suburb the nowâ€“25-year-old singer-songwriter describes as overrun ""with like 50 banks"" â€“ hasn't really been home for a while.The past couple of years have been a whirlwind for Toledo. Following a series of beloved cult records released on Bandcamp, his solo-projectâ€“turned-band Car Seat Headrest was signed to indie-rock bastion Matador in 2015. He put together a touring group with guitarist Ethan Ives, bassist Seth Dalby and drummer Andrew Katz, and in 2016, put out the expansive album Teens of Denial, which earned him wide acclaim, and placed fourth on Rolling Stone's Best Albums of 2016 list. With his penchant for grandiose songcraft, slashing guitars and earworm-y melodies, Toledo has been hailed by some as the latest in a line of left-field rock legends including Television's Tom Verlaine, Guided by Voices' Robert Pollard and Pavement's Stephen Malkmus. And, fittingly for an opinionated artist on the rise, he's publicly thrown shade at everything from Sufjan Stevens' Carrie &amp; Lowell LP to Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why â€“ and coped with the attendant social-media fallout.&nbsp;It's December 2016 and Toledo's purpose for enduring Decade's spartan conditions in the dead of the sub-zero Chicago winter is clear. He's here to breathe new life into the greatest artistic achievement of his relatively brief but impressively prolific career, by recording, mixing and mastering an enhanced version of his poignant, quasi-autobiographical 2011 album,&nbsp;Twin Fantasy. It might seem like an odd move to revisit an old album as a follow-up to a critically heralded breakout LP â€“ at a time when more eyes are on him than ever â€“ but Toledo either doesn't pay attention to this notion or simply doesn't care. This is something he has to do and, in fact, was part of his initial deal when he signed with Matador. It will take many months to get his Twin Fantasy remake exactly right, requiring multiple visits back to the cozy confines of that little room, and countless demanding hours sitting in front of a recording console, tweaking every guitar break, every drum fill, every ""yip,"" ""ooh"" and ""ahh.""His band's overstuffed schedule of summer festival appearances and a grueling run through Europe in the fall of 2016, which he cites as the low point of the past two years â€“ ""being on that bus with no sleep and just the same task day after day and feeling like we're getting nowhere"" â€“ makes the recording even more laborious, but Toledo's meticulous attention to detail culminates in a sonic document that towers over the crusty, lo-fi original. Listening to the albums back to back â€“ the new version, also called Twin Fantasy, will be out February 16th â€“ is like watching the IMAX version of a film you've only ever seen in grainy Super 8.""This one has totally replaced the old one in my mind,"" Toledo says. ""I was not in the same place then. It felt at times like doing a cover record. The old one is by a different artist that I don't necessarily like as much as the one I've turned into.""Twin Fantasy is, in broad strokes, a concept album. It's a hooky, euphoric and intensely raw snapshot of a doe-eyed college relationship. Its style is confessional, if not a bit meandering, with scenes and set pieces that would ring embarrassingly true to anyone who's ever made it out of the most vulnerable state of adolescence. Late nights. Drunken debauchery. Uttered truths you desperately wish you could take back. In more succinct terms, it's the sound of someone figuring out exactly who they are.When asked how much of his own life can be gleaned from the record, Toledo keeps his responses vague. ""I think that it's an emotional arc that's real, and it was inspired by real events,"" he allows. ""At this point, there's so much layered on top of it that it's hard to tell a straightforward narrative about it, but it definitely deals with events that were important to me at the time and still are."" When asked if the record involves people still within his orbit, he smiles shyly and lowers his head. ""We keep in touch.""The big question is, why now? Why revisit your past self at this particular moment? ""I kind of felt that these were demos I was recording when I was doing the original thing,"" he explains, leaning back into a couch. ""I felt like I could re-record it better. So far, it's worked out.""Ask some of Car Seat Headrest's most ardent fans and they'll often cite Twin Fantasy as their favorite among Toledo's many projects, surpassing even the emotional resonance of the critically adored Teens of Denial. While some artists might worry about tinkering with a record already beloved by the most hardcore subset of their fan base, Toledo is pretty sanguine about the prospect. ""I'm interested to see what they'll think,"" he says. ""They might not be OK with how we treat the old record. It might get wiped for a little bit. I'm sure we'll get complaints about that, but they can deal with it.""Given the time, space and resources he's been afforded to tinker with the music he first recorded on a computer at 19, his goal is no less than sonic perfection. Some nights he sits with headphones on, going over a single line over and over again, adding a bit of compression here or a different kind of filter there just to see how it will affect the total mix. A singular scream of the word ""That!"" in the song ""Beach Life-in-Death"" takes up almost a whole evening. Ripping off his headphones, he reveals the culprit of his concern. ""I hear a clicking,"" he says, before ceding the chair and allowing his engineer to have a listen. This song is of particular importance. It was the first one that he re-completed, and as such, it set the tone for the aural expansiveness he was after for his new Twin Fantasy. In the song's present state, there are 20 different guitar parts layered together in the opening section alone. ""Back in July we had a version with about half a dozen, and it just felt empty,"" Toledo explains dryly. ""It's really about getting it perfect,"" he says of the focus and energy he's dedicated to the project. ""It's coming out right at a certain peak in my career where a lot of people are going to be listening to it, and I think it's going to be around for a while, so I just really wanted to make sure that I could go in and listen to it five years from now and not really regret any of the decisions I made production-wise."" Self-satisfaction is only one of the factors fueling his determination. The other is plain ambition. ""I think at this point my goal with each album is to bring in a new audience. With Teens of Denial we brought in a much wider crowd within the indie circle, and I hope with this new record we can bring in a crowd beyond that. As far as mainstream appeal, I think it's super clean. It doesn't really sound like an indie-rock record to me. It sounds like a pop record to me. That was one of my goals going into it, and I'm really happy with how it came out. It's clean and accessible, but it's dense and it interests me at the same time. It's changing constantly.""""Changing constantly"" is a good description of Toledo's life ever since he signed with Matador, graduating from a Bandcamp buzz artist to one of the premier up-and-coming rock acts of the moment. Since Teens, he's performed everywhere from the U.K., Australia and major U.S. festival stages to a resort town in Italy where Car Sear Headrest played a sparsely attended gig for just 40 fans. ""Our sound guy said, 'No, it's 200.' But you could literally count the people."" He spent his most recent birthday on a tour bus watching episodes of Mad Men. The benefit of all this time on the road, as draining as it's been, is that Car Seat Headrest are more of a band than they ever were before, even while Toledo likes to retain his auteur role in the studio. ""It feels like a band when we're performing live and when we're touring,"" he says. ""Recording is sort of opposite from that. They come in and I tell them what to do; they head out and I keep working. It seems to work out fine. I think in the future we'll collaborate more on making stuff together.""As he considers the next steps in his musical evolution, one figure has emerged as a sort of signpost for where he wants to go. ""In the past two years, David Bowie has come to the forefront as the sort of model for writing,"" he says. ""He wasn't really ever really writing super universal stuff. Even when he was collaborating with Queen to make 'Under Pressure,' he's singing lines that are a lot darker than what Freddie Mercury is singing, and it's a great contrast. But at the same time, he was a pop writer. And who knows what was going on with him when he was writing this stuff, but it feels very personal.""Classic rock â€“ the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd â€“ has always been the wellspring that Toledo has drawn from while creating his own grand artistic statements, but lately he's been incorporating other influences as well. One late evening â€“ deep into the mixing process, after a long session tracking a new version of ""Beach Life-in-Death"" â€“ we take a break and head out to grab some juice at a nearby convenience store. Along the way, Toledo expresses his admiration for the performance ability of James Brown, which is echoed on the song ""Cute Thing"" â€“ ""God, give me Frank Ocean's voice/And James Brown's stage presence"" â€“ and has lately given thought to making his bandmates dress up in uniform. He later marvels at Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral, singling out Trent Reznor's plaintive ballad ""Hurt"" for special praise, while also copping to having been entranced by the visuals Frank Ocean assembled for&nbsp;Blonde.&nbsp;When Toledo returns to the studio, however, rather than dig back into the work at hand, he takes a seat as the engineer, Adam, dials up the White Album, and we spend the rest of the evening praising John Lennon, while mostly skipping through Paul compositions like ""Rocky Raccoon"" and ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da."" George gets a lot of love as well. While Car Seat Headrest have, and no doubt forever will, draw comparisons to the likes of Pavement and Guided by Voices, with their gnarly, overdriven soundworlds, to really understand where Toledo is coming from, you have to consider his work through the lens of the Fab Four.In classic Lennon-like fashion, Toledo's unabashed, publicly stated opinions have caused several headaches during the past year. There was a short dust-up after he disparaged Sufjan Stevens' album Carrie &amp; Lowell, and his swipe at the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why â€“&nbsp;Toledo called its portrayal of teen suicide ""kind of fucked"" â€“ which featured one of his songs, incited an online brouhaha. A sub-beef with Titus Andronicus frontman Patrick Stickles followed.""After that, I have consciously avoided inciting controversy in my public statements,"" he says. ""I think it's for the best. Why bother voicing a negative opinion unless it's a persuasive argument? Why not present it in a way that you're not looking like an asshole? I think those are decent lessons to take away from it.""Toledo noticeably perks up when talk turns to the future. A few months back, while sitting in one of the stiff, plastic booths of a McDonalds within walking distance of the recording studio that was and wasn't home for the past year, he reflected on what he's managed to accomplish.""I think I achieved what I set out to do,"" he says optimistically in between bites of a cheeseburger. ""I kind of had everything sort of neatly tied up in my mind, but when it came time to put some of the last touches on it, I kind of left it unfinished in a way. Or some stuff, I added without knowing exactly what it meant, which is better. I think the original was kind of like that. Maybe when I revisit this one in seven years, I'll understand more about it. Right now, I have less of an idea about what it's about than I ever did before.""Oh, and that little room? ""I don't miss it, but it was convenient.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Annie Zaleski,2018-02-01T18:32:00.000Z,New Initiative Hopes to Bring #MeToo to the Music Industry,"#metoo, sexism, music industry, sexual misconduct",Rolling Stone,"When music industry executives Meg Harkins and Karen Rait discovered there wasn't a formal nod to the Time's Up coalition happening at the 2018 Grammy Awards, the women â€“ who work as an SVP of Marketing at Roc Nation and in rhythmic promotion at Interscope/Geffen/A&amp;M Records, respectively â€“ decided to take action themselves. Less than a week before the ceremony, the duo founded Voices In Entertainment (VIE), a grassroots music industry analog to Hollywood's anti-sexual harassment movement.Inspired by Time's Up, VIE spearheaded a campaign for Grammy attendees to wear white roses as a show of support for ""equal representation in the workplace, for leadership that reflects the diversity of our society, workplaces free of sexual harassment and a heightened awareness of accountability,"" the group said in a statement. Despite the last-minute notice, artists such as Pink, Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, Nick Jonas, Jason Isbell, Little Big Town and Rapsody were spotted sporting white roses at the event.With the Grammys over, VIE â€“ whose core team members represent radio, public relations and label executives alongside on-air talent â€“ plans to continue working to enact change in the music industry. Although Harkins stresses several times how new VIE is â€“ ""We're trying to figure out our second meeting,"" she says with a laugh â€“ she is heartened by the initial responses and outreach they've received. She&nbsp;spoke to Rolling Stone about where the organization is going next.What are the organization's goals for the future?There are entertainment groups in the music industry that we've been talking to. I went to a meeting with Dr. Stacy Smith, who put out the pretty eye-opening report last week with [the] USC Annenberg [Inclusion Initiative] about the number of women who have received Grammys over the last six years and the number of female producers and writers. [The study showed over the past six years, only 12.3% of songwriters were female on average, while only 9.3% of Grammy nominees from 2013-2018 were female.] There's a really amazing group of very strong, powerful women who are involved with that. So we're talking with them. We're talking with a lot of women to find out â€” and figure out â€” the best next steps.What tangible changes do you want to see in the music industry because of this work?The three tangible goals for us moving forward are A. mentorship B. getting more women in the C-suite and C. education for the current group of young women in the music industry so that they can understand their worth, what their paths can be and having more women represented across the board â€“ whether it's in production, live [events], agents [or] record executives. We need to encourage women at all points and we do that by mentoring. That's our first step.What are the challenges to achieving those goals?I think we're going to get the resources. Right now, it's just time. We have to organize it so that we can be very inclusive and make sure that we set new goals for this year. I'd like to see us set some concrete goals along those three pieces. There are lots of festivals; there are a lot more nights in music that are coming up. There are lots of opportunities for us to have more public moments, but I think now we need to work within ourselves to get the women who have already spoken up and been supportive that have powerful positions to help move that ball forward.How do you see Voices In Entertainment fitting in with the Time's Up movement? Do you see yourselves working together more closely in the future?We would love that. The most important part of the Time's Up movement is they currently have a $20 million legal defense fund. That fund is available to anyone, woman or man, who's feeling discriminated against in any industry. To me, that's a super-important [thing]. They've done the legwork to set up that fund and that takes a lot.I'm not interested myself in running a nonprofit. [Laughs.] I would rather use the tools and the resources and the camaraderie and the sisterhood of the Time's Up movement. But this makes us stronger. That's what we'll figure out moving forward: how much we can do as the entertainment industry on the music side to work. Because it's not just about us; it's not about entertainers. It's about other women who work everywhere.There have been many conversations in recent months about the music industry's ingrained structural inequalities, in particular where gender is concerned. How do you see Voices in Entertainment fitting into a larger conversation about the lack of parity?Well, I'm a voting NARAS member, and I would love to see conversation open up about how voting membership requirements work. Try to address them to it be more inclusive, and try to understand how that works. But parity only happens when we have women and men at the highest levels of any organization that care about it. We've started that conversation about caring, and we have to find those people and help move it forward by not just saying, ""Yes, I'll wear a white rose,"" but changing workplace policies and culture.What are some challenges to enacting change in a music industry workplace?I don't have those concerns in my workplace. I work with a lot of women in a lot of powerful positions. But those are just conversations that have to be had. If you're at a major label, you have to have it with HR. There have to be ways that we can start implementing more transparent paths for women. It's about creating more paths, and more mentorship, and making sure that we're in those paths.Why did you personally feel so drawn to be a founding member of this organization?It really struck a chord with me. I have a daughter, and I want to make sure that no one who has a daughter has to worry about blatant sexism â€“ or worse â€“ in the workplace. It lit a fire in me. I really responded to it. It's something that I'm completely passionate and 100 percent [about]. Moving forward, 2018 is my year of grassroots activism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Rob Sheffield,2018-01-25T16:51:17.824Z,Remembering the Fall's Mark E. Smith: The Man With Punk's Most Evil Sneer,"mark e. smith, the fall",Rolling Stone,"Admit it: You thought Mark E. Smith would be the last to go. And in a way, he was the last to go â€“ when the punk legend died on Wednesday, after 40 years leading the U.K. band the Fall, he took most of the world's bile with him. ""There are 12 people in the world â€“ the rest are paste,"" Smith snarled in his 1981 anthem ""The Classical,"" and nobody's sure if Smith ever met the other 11. Somehow he was only 60, but he'd never seemed young. The ""Hip Priest"" had the most evil sneer in rock &amp; roll, punctuating his rants with a sarcastic ""aaaah"" to give every word a serpentine hiss. He hired and fired dozens of bandmates, notoriously terrorizing anyone foolish enough to join his band, yet no matter who was in the Fall, you could always recognize them instantly â€“ he stuck with his signature jagged guitar groove for life. Every time Mark E. Smith spat on the ground, another 10 bands rose up, and he hated every one of them.Mark E. Smith was legendary as the most cantankerous bastard in town â€“ and his town was Manchester. In his dozens of Fall records, he created his own wonderful and frightening (but especially frightening) world. He stayed mean right up to the end. ""People still cross the road from me; I've still got that,"" he said in his final interview. ""I can clear a pub when I want to. It's a talent."" If there's a punk heaven, Mark E. Smith is already on his third drummer.If his huge and sprawling catalog seems too daunting to explore, it's easy â€“ start with ""The Classical,"" a song that sums him up perfectly, from the 1981 masterwork Hex Enduction Hour, a monster groove with two drummers and crazy bass. ""Hey there, fuckface-aaaah! Hey there, fuckface â€“ aaaah!"" Smith announces at the outset; it's his way of welcoming you in. He harangues away with insults (""This is the home of the vain! There is no culture!""), complaints about how it all sounds too pretty (""too much romantic here""), bad jokes (""I just left the Hotel Amnesia ... where it is, I can't remember""), advice (""Kill it! Kill it!"") and cultural commentary: ""You won't find anything more ridiculous than this new profile razor unit, made with the highest British attention to the wrong detail."" At the end, the song explodes into the sarcastic chant, ""I never felt better in my liiiiife"" â€“ he makes it terrifyingly true. Smith was a working-class lad who left school at 16 to become a Salford dockworker who read voraciously by night. Then he heard the Sex Pistols, decided he could do better, and began one of punk's longest, strangest careers, a hard-drinking left-wing literary autodidact and self-proclaimed ""Prole Art Threat."" ""The difference between you and us is that we have brains,"" he told the crowd on an early live album. He set the tone for his whole career with early anthems like ""Totally Wired"" (""I drank a jar full of coffee and then I took some of these"") and ""Repetition."" He was notoriously fond of lager, whiskey, speed â€“ like MotÃ¶rhead's Lemmy, who he resembles in so many ways, he thrived at a chemical pace that would have turned anyone else to slush. When a rock star dies, other musicians line up to share affectionate memories of their warmth and compassion. This will not happen to Mark E. Smith. He famously fired a soundman for ordering a salad. (In his defense, Smith said ""the salad was the last straw"", dismissing his ex-bandmates as ""dickheads who couldn't hold their beer and needed to get home to Cheshire."")&nbsp;He scared away so many musicians, the journalist Dave Simpson wrote a 2008 book called The Fallen compiling their horror stories â€“ one of them quit by escaping from the van on the freeway during a snowstorm. He liked to dismantle his bandmates' equipment onstage, just to keep them from getting too slick. He fined his drummer five pounds every time he hit the tom-tom. On his disastrous 1998 visit to New York, the band disintegrated into an onstage fistfight that ended with Smith in jail for a couple of days.But no matter how legendary his offstage personality, it was his music where Mark E. Smith truly became the stuff of nightmares. You can spend years exploring his catalog without coming close to figuring this guy out. The Fall hit their stride with the perfect 1980 EP Slates, in blurts like ""Leave the Capitol"" and ""Fit and Working Again!!"" At one point on Slates, he orders the band, ""Don't start improvising, for God's sake."" (When Pavement made Slanted and Enchanted, their future label boss Gerard Cosloy praised them in in his zine Conflict as ""a Slates tribute band"" â€“ the ultimate compliment.) ""The only thing real is waking and rubbing your eyes,"" he announced in ""How I Wrote Elastic Man.""His music took a totally unexpected turn in the early Eighties when he arrived home with a young American bride on his arm. Brix Smith was a blonde California art girl who was glam, tuneful, flashy and a few dozen other things that Mark E. Smith wasn't. They were perfect for each other, as her eccentric pop flair fit his caustic two-chord minimalism. They meshed beautifully in the 1983 Perverted by Language â€“ especially in ""Hotel Bloedel,"" where her doomy crooning meets his slang-king snarl over droning violin for a profoundly creepy sound.Thus the Fall began their ""pop"" phase â€“ the punch line was that only a diehard Fall fan could confuse this music for pop, yet they somehow blundered onto the U.K. charts with a daft attack on the Kinks' ""Victoria."" They hit a roll with an almost B-52's-like sound, with Brix as the Kate/Cindy yin to his Fred Schneider yang, in classics like This Nation's Saving Grace and The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall. Before the marriage crashed (Brix became a famous London fashion designer) they left behind one of the era's most perfect greatest-hits records, 458459 A Sides. In the 1985 ""L.A.,"" Smith rants about Hollywood (surprise, he hates it) while Brix chants a quote from Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: ""This is my happening, and it freaks me out!"" But the unlikely peak is the 1988 freakout ""Big New Prinz,"" with Mark barking his dark gibberish: ""Check the record, check the record, check the guy's rock record! He is nuts!"" Sinister, funny, scary, fascinating â€“ everything this man was. Smith kept churning out music right to the end. He made 30 albums, or 31 or 32 or something like that â€“ part of the fun in being a Fall fan was knowing that even Smith wasn't keeping score. Despite his rigorous ethic, they varied widely in quality, especially in the Nineties, after Brix left and things got dark. The Infotainment Scam was mind-blowingly bad in that ""influenced by acid house in 1990"" kind of way, while 1994's Middle Class Revolt was a hearty blast with ""You're Not Up to Much."" He remained a legendary crank â€“ check out his infamous 2007 interview on the U.K. chat show, Transmission, where the poor host tries a harmless question about why he's so tough on his bandmates. ""People seem to go a bit crackers when they're around me,"" he says with a straight face. ""I'm a nice fellow, as you can see."" When the jazzman Chet Baker died in 1988, art critic Dave Hickey paid tribute by pointing out that Baker ""died with gigs left to play, thus deserving the freelancer's ultimate epitaph: 'If This Dude Wasn't Dead, He Could Still Get Work.'"" Mark E. Smith went that one better: He died with gigs still getting cancelled on him. The Fall had an oft-delayed, oft-rescheduled string of NYC shows booked for February at Brooklyn's Baby's All Right; they sold out instantly, even though literally nobody thought these shows would ever happen. Here's to Mark E. Smith, a lesson for us all in how to remain magnificently yourself and unshakably tough. A man made with the highest British attention to the wrong detail. Rest in rancor, Mr. Smith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Sleepwalking is what you do all day long,"" quips the father of two. ""This isn't even a record, it's more of a parenting manual.""As the lead singer of New Jersey quartet the Gaslight Anthem, Fallon gave rock fans their own wake-up call by tearing a page straight from the Gospel of Springsteen â€“ crafting high-energy sing-alongs that both lamented and exalted the blue-collar life. When Gaslight went on indefinite hiatus in 2015, he took the opportunity to turn down the volume and branch out, opting for more nuanced indie-rock fare with the band the Horrible Crowes, and then favoring the fragile over the ferocious on his 2016 Butch Walker-produced solo album,&nbsp;Painkillers.On Sleepwalkers, Fallon both returns to and embraces the muscular rock he flexed with the Gaslight Anthem on their celebrated 2008 breakout The '59 Sound, reuniting with that album's producer Ted Hutt, and adding elements of Sixties soul, doo-wop and sneering punk to create his most satisfying non-Gaslight project to date.But he's also revived the Gaslight Anthem, with the band announcing a series of special shows tied to the 10th anniversary of The '59 Sound, which they'll play in its entirety on a world tour this summer.Talking to Fallon, equal parts wisecracking and whip-smart, it's clear that despite all the late-2000s hype and pressure of being the next Springsteen (with whom he's shared a stage), he's comfortable in his musical skin.""Everyone always says, 'We don't want to be pigeonholed.' But sometimes your pigeonhole is a great place to be,"" says the 38-year-old. ""I would say that Dylan's got his pigeon â€“ this is what Dylan does and no one does this except for him. Grunge became Pearl Jam's pigeonhole. They overtook it, you know? At the end of the day you can't reinvent yourself past a point, because you are you, and there are things that are inherently you that are always going to be there.""For Fallon, it's the Springsteen/Clash amalgamation that defined his work with the Gaslight Anthem and that, with an extra dash of Dylan, informs Sleepwalkers, whose title track could have fit nicely on Greetings From Asbury Park. Bolstered by horns from the Preservation Hall Jazz Band â€“ Fallon recorded the album in New Orleans â€“ the tune mixes the boardwalk R&amp;B of the singer's native Garden State with the funk of the Crescent City. It's one of many standouts on the new album, along with the street-corner hymn ""If Your Prayers Don't Get to Heaven"" (his current single), the stark look at mortality ""See You on the Other Side"" and the love song ""Etta James."" Fallon has a habit of referencing his heroes in songs. On The '59 Sound, it was Miles Davis; on Painkillers, he sang about Steve McQueen.""I feel like all these characters carry a trail behind them. They leave a legacy,"" he says. ""I got [the idea of referencing] from hip-hop. If you look at the Seventies and especially the Eighties, New York and East Coast hip-hop was always referencing the culture. With that song, I was saying I've got this feeling about this person and the best way I've heard it conveyed is through Etta James. Those references are bigger than my writing and bigger than the audience, but they're ingrained in the memory.""""Brian is the consummate student of rock &amp; roll,"" says likeminded singer-songwriter Dave Hause, who will open a string of shows for Fallon this month in Europe. ""He's studying, listening, trying always to get better. He's the proof that the student almost always becomes the master.""Hause's words are brought to bear in Sleepwalkers' lead single ""Forget Me Not,"" perhaps the song on the LP that most subscribes to the Gaslight Anthem '59 formula: ""Old White Lincoln"" pre-chorus, gang vocal harmonies and a Fallon scream to open each verse.Prior to production, Fallon, Hutt and his frequent collaborator, solo artist Matthew Ryan, talked at length about how much of the Gaslight aesthetic to let seep into Sleepwalkers. They decided not to fight it.""Even though it's not necessarily [a Gaslight Anthem album], one-fourth of the band's sound is always whatever I brought to the table. That's mine, in anything that I do. It'd be like saying, 'OK, I'm not going to use my left arm,'"" says Fallon. ""I'm just going to embrace everything I do and not hold anything back, because I like this sound.""In May, Fallon will join the other three-quarters of Gaslight Anthem â€“ Alex Rosamilia, Alex Levine and Benny Horowitz â€“ to mark the 10th anniversary of The '59 Sound with shows in Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York, where they're part of the lineup of the Governor's Ball Music Festival. Fallon admits the decade milestone was one that he and the band didn't know if they wanted to commemorate at all. ""Do we do something? Do we ignore it?"" he recalls. ""The big thing between us was let's just do what's fun. So if it's heavy-handed and not that cool, then let's not do it. But we all feel that this is an important record to not only us, but to the people that love it. I would not be on the phone talking about my Sleepwalkers record had it not been for The '59 Sound.""Fallon says it was the pressure and all those Springsteen comparisons that led the group to split in the first place. ""We released two records, and all of a sudden we were playing with Bruce Springsteen, and there was all this, 'You guys are going to be the next Boss.' And we were like, 'Whoa. I don't know.'""While more U.S. shows may be added to the summer tour â€“ it'll also hit Europe in July â€“ Fallon cautions against expecting a new Gaslight album. ""I think Green Day's American Idiot is probably the best comeback or mid-career record that any band has done. So if I was sitting on American Idiot level stuff, then I might push for the, 'Hey guys, maybe we should try these songs out.' But I'm not sitting on that. I don't have a Born to Run in me.""Fallon is looking forward to the big stages of the Gaslight Anthem tour, which he'll work in between his own solo shows, but he's ultimately content to make a living in theaters, communing with fellow hopers and dreamers. To Fallon, there's something inspiring about New Jersey rock &amp; roll.""It has a sense of there's something just over the horizon, and I can see it and reach it,"" he says. ""If we can survive long enough.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Steve Appleford,2018-01-18T20:17:42.015Z,"Aerosmith's Joe Perry Talks Stripped-Down New Solo Album, Fiery Release Show","joe perry, joe perry sweetzerland manifesto, joe perry live, aerosmith, joe perry aerosmith, joe perry solo album, joe perry steven tyler, aerosmith toxic twins, aerosmith tour, aerosmith retirement",Rolling Stone,"Aerosmith's Joe Perry knows something about getting lost in the moment. It happened for the latest time during the final seconds of his show this week celebrating the release of a new solo album at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, where guitarists Perry, Slash, Johnny Depp and Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots were raging through a supercharged ""Train Kept A-Rollin',"" a song at the core of Perry's musical life ever since he first heard the Yardbirds' version as a teenager.            ""It's one of the best basic fucking guitar riffs in rock &amp; roll,"" Perry told Rolling Stone the day after his set. It was also a hit for Aerosmith in 1974, and Tuesday night's performance aimed at incorporating the best elements of every take going back to the 1951 original by Tiny Bradshaw. ""We hit every fucking version of the E chord that you could imagine,"" he says. ""Everything was screaming; the amps were going. I didn't know what else to do. All of a sudden my guitar was in pieces.""            Perry smashed his guitar onstage. ""It was a really a nice guitar, and the guy who made it for me was in the front row,"" Perry says. ""That's why I'm feeling bad about it. It was not anything I planned. It was just that the energy was overwhelming.""It was a ferocious finish to a two-hour performance of hard rock and muscular blues ahead of Friday's release of Sweetzerland Manifesto, which features an all-star cast of singers including Cheap Trick's Robin Zander, the New York Dolls' David Johansen and U.K. veteran Terry Reid. Making the album was a long-term project, beginning with a recording of Sixties pop hit ""Eve of Destruction"" in 2012, but picked up steam last year. It was recorded at Depp's home studio in the Hollywood Hills.            ""It's like an enclave that doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the world,"" Perry says of the studio. ""It's like an artists' refuge â€“ he's got writers up there, painters. There are comedians that come up. Oddly enough, not a lot of actors, other than Johnny. It's a place where creativity is probably the most important thing. It's a state of mind almost.""            ""I love to record. I love to be in the studio.  I love to experiment,"" he adds. ""This was just another way to go about it.""            While Aerosmith remains at the center of Perry's career, the years between albums from the multi-platinum rock &amp; roll band leave him restless. His solo career first erupted after he quit Aerosmith in 1979 and launched the Joe Perry Project with an album called Let the Music Do the Talking. The title song was a fired up statement from a lead guitarist stepping out on his own and leaving his need for a lead singer behind.            ""It was the end of the Seventies,"" Perry recalled of his abrupt exit from Aerosmith. ""We were pretty burned out. We had been busting our asses for eight or nine years, playing everywhere, trying to make it. If we had been a little wiser, we would have just taken a vacation. We just kept going until basically we had a meltdown.""            ""Let the Music Do the Talking"" was an exciting enough song that Aerosmith re-recorded it after Perry returned in 1984, and it was back again at the Roxy as the night's opening salvo, with the guitarist on raging bottleneck. While the original plan for Sweetzerland Manifesto was for Perry to make his first all-instrumental solo album, he found himself drawn once again to some accomplished singers of ""gumption and audacity.""            ""I love rock &amp; roll, and it's tough even for me to hear an instrumental version of the kind of music I like,"" Perry says. ""Once in a while I'll do one. But people want to hear a singer, and I want to hear a singer."" His longtime creative partner and onetime ""Toxic Twin"" in Aerosmith, singer Steven Tyler, ""is obviously one of the best to come down the pike.""            Co-producing with Bruce Witkin, Perry also had occasional input from Jack Douglas, producer of Aerosmith's career-defining albums in the 1970s. Later in the process, the guitarist's sons â€“ DJ Roman Perry and musician-producer Tony Perry (who mixed the record) â€“ weighed in. ""I sit back and listen to what they have to say,"" the guitarist recalls. ""Nobody is as interested anymore in hearing guitar gymnastics. Sometimes a really good riff is enough to carry the day. It's all about the song again. I learned that from my kids.""            The album release show was billed as Joe Perry and Friends, and the guitar hero arrived onstage in classic style: layers of chains and scarves, in a tuxedo jacket and dark shades, a streak of white accenting a thick mane of black hair. The band included STP's Dean and Robert DeLeo on guitar and bass, respectively. Later, they were joined on rhythm guitar by Depp (a member of the band Hollywood Vampires with Perry and Alice Cooper).            Standing in for Tyler on a few Aerosmith songs early in the set was Extreme vocalist Gary Cherone, in ragged scarves and headband. Then Perry leaned into the mic: ""Were not going to be playing anymore of that shit for a while.""            The band jumped into playing the new album in rough order. Reid began with the album's ""I'll Do Happiness,"" a cry of angry love that was dark and bluesy. Like most of the night, the sound was forceful, but not overly polished. ""Won't Let Me Go"" shook to a bruising rhythm from the DeLeo brothers, leaving room for Perry to unfurl an aching rock solo.The delivery was serious but never precious, at times coming off like a living room jam session. When Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson showed up bearded and feisty for ""Fortunate One,"" the song was over much too quickly for Perry, who immediately said, ""Want to play it again?"" And they did.            Robinson joined the album project late, after the CD was already mastered, so his song will be a bonus track exclusive to the deluxe vinyl version of Sweetzerland.            Johansen brought a lip-smacking growl to ""I Wanna Roll,"" standing center-stage in a crisp white shirt, beard and mustache sculpted razor thin, and blew some blues harp on ""I'm Going Crazy."" He also joked that he knew Perry as a small child: ""He said to his mother, 'Mommy, when I grow up, I'm going to be a musician.' His mother said, 'You better make up your mind Joey, because you can't do both.'""            Perry's guitar turned noisy and meditative for the instrumental ""Spanish Sushi,"" supported by some thundering beats from drummer David Goodstein. The crowd included Gene Simmons of Kiss, ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons and GN'R vets Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum.            Toward the end of the night, Zander delivering biting melodic vocals on two songs, including the vinyl-only ""Countryside Boulevard."" For the set's encore, he returned to shout the opening lines of the Beatles' ""Come Together."" Reid and Robinson took turns on the song, stepping back for Perry to take another molten lead.            Later in January, Perry says, he expects to be recording the next Hollywood Vampires album, and tour dates are booked with the band in May and June, with a few scattered U.S. shows. And with Aerosmith in their 38th year, they'll likely to tour again late in 2018, as Perry pushes for another Aerosmith record.            Somewhere in that busy schedule, Perry hopes to perform more one-off solo gigs with his Sweetzerland players. ""Who knows if we'll ever get that lineup again? I hope we do,"" says Perry, the Roxy set still fresh in his mind. ""I just hope everybody had as much fun as I did.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Brian Hiatt,2018-01-29T22:35:00.000Z,Hear Franz Ferdinand Break Down Their New Album 'Always Ascending',Franz Ferdinand,Rolling Stone,"Franz Ferdinand made one of the greatest debuts of all time back in 2004 with their self-titled LP â€“ 11 tracks of flawless disco-punk that could've been a lesser band's greatest-hits package. They've never been daunted by the mixed blessing of having started so strong â€“ not even now, as they plan to release another debut of sorts, February 9th's strong Always Ascending. It's their first album without departed guitarist Nick McCarthy, and with new member Julian Corrie, who adds dashes of electronics into the mix. ""It's still us,"" says frontman Alex Kapranos, ""but it's maybe trying to do some new things.""For the latest episode of the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast, Kapranos and bassist Bob Hardy joined the show's host, Brian Hiatt, to discuss the making of their new album, the changes in the band, their place in the rock revival of the 2000s, and much more â€“ including their review of Justin Timberlake's ""Supplies."" To hear the entire discussion, see below or download and subscribe on iTunes or Spotify.The new album's producer, Phillipe Zdar, had a strict prohibition against over-focusing on any one song. ""We had this rule, actually, when we were making this record,"" says Kapranos, ""that nobody would mention singles, that you wouldn't talk about singles, because as Philippe puts it, 'All the other songs become jealous if you say what the single is.' Which is such a good attitude, and so to choose a single, what we do is really play the record to our friends or our family and the ones they respond to ... it kind of becomes obvious at that point that people like that song.""A line on the new song ""Lois Lane"" that refers to the bleakness of an ""over-30s single night"" was based on a real experience. ""When I was about 24 I was staying at this flat in Glasgow,"" says Kapranos, ""and I had a flatmate who was a bit older than me. He had a friend who was a bit older and he had a 30th birthday&nbsp; â€“ and as a joke we all went round to the over-30s singles night in the hotel around the corner. And it just seemed like the most depressing thing in the world to me at the age of 24, the idea of being over 30! Never mind single. Yeah. I'm over 30 now. A long way over 30.""Another new song, ""Huck and Jim,"" includes a Franz Ferdinand take on trap hi-hats.&nbsp;""We thought like, 'Ah, that's really cool, but I've never heard a band playing that. It's always programmed,' so [drummer Paul Thomson]&nbsp; was playing with that a lot on this record and, and you hear it in 'Huck and Jim.' That's our weird, white way of trying to play something like that."" The song includes the memorable image of&nbsp; ""sipping 40s with Huck and Jim,"" which Kapranos explains as follows: ""The first line of that chorus is, 'We're going to America / going to tell them about the NHS,' and the song just sounded the most American thing we've ever done sonically. We love the NHS and it's being dismantled in the U.K., and it's what I talk about with a lot of my American friends, the idea of health care and the idea that it's the heart of civilization. And then I wanted to pick a character from history or literature or my experience that sums up America and the first figure that popped in my head was Huckleberry [Finn] â€“ and then I realized that, 'Well, that book's not just about him, but it's about him and Jim.' Yeah, those two figures sum up America in quite a few ways.""Kapranos is looking forward to a long creative career.&nbsp;""I think it was a lot of harder in the Fifties and Sixties to be over the age of 22 and still playing in the band,"" he says. ""Now quite a few folk have aged before us. If you look at somebody like Bowie making that incredible record just before his 70th birthday when he died, it's obvious to anybody that you can maintain a high level of creative impetus throughout your life.""Franz never saw themselves as a world-conquering stadium band. ""I know when we got a band together, nobody mentioned conquering anything,"" Kapranos says. ""That was never the desire. To get to that kind of level of playing stadiums and that being your life, you really have to want to do it and I don't [know] if we really have the obsession with that to get there.""Kapranos is only faintly aware of the current boom in 2000s nostalgia, and never saw themselves as part of that era's so-called rock revival, anyway.&nbsp;""I'm just managing to get my head around the Nineties revival, not the 2000s,"" he says. ""I guess if there were any sort of parallels, we were closer to bands like the Rapture and&nbsp; LCD Soundsystem, where they were coming from. But you know, we toured with Interpol. That was our first tour, opening up for Interpol in the U.K. They're cool guys. There's a connection there.""They've never grown to dislike their first hit, ""Take Me Out."" ""You hear stories about bands resenting songs that they've written in the past, because they've become popular,"" says Kapranos, ""and, to me, that just seems absurd. If you're sick of playing the song, just don't play the song anymore and don't moan about it. You know? It's a good song to play. I like it."" The main thing he recalls about its creation is a technical problem:&nbsp;""When we first wrote it, we couldn't get the tempo right. The verses sounded better played a little bit faster and the chorus sounded better played a little slower and we could never quite work it out. And then one day I had this idea that, 'Ah, right, guys. We're going to take all of the verses, put them at the beginning of the song, and then we're going to slow it down and play all the choruses,' which is kind of the wrong way to do it, but it kind of works in that song.""Download and subscribe to Rolling Stone Music Now on iTunes or Spotify, and tune in Fridays at 1 p.m. ET to hear the show broadcast live on Sirius XM's Volume, channel 106.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Andy Greene,2018-01-09T16:31:00.000Z,Chris Robinson on Why He's Ready to Sing Black Crowes Songs Again,"Chris Robinson Interview, Chris Robinson tour, As The Crow Flies, As The Crow Flies tour, Chris Robinson tour dates, as the crow flies band, chris robinson rich robinson, chris rich robinson, black crowes albums, black crowes songs",Rolling Stone,"It's been more than four years since the&nbsp;Black Crowes split following an epic show at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. In that time, Crowes guitarist Rich Robinson has kept their music alive in his spinoff group the Magpie Salute, but his brother Chris has focused on the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, a jam band that plays almost nothing from the Crowes catalog. He hasn't even sung many of their songs in any capacity since the group folded, but that's going to change on April 17th when his new band As the Crow Flies kicks off a 17-show tour in Port Chester, New York.&nbsp;The group â€“ which features Black Crowes alumni Adam MacDougall (keyboard), Andy Hess (bass) and Audley Freed (guitar), along with Marcus King (guitar) and Tony Leone (drums) â€“ will play a set consisting almost entirely of Black Crowes songs. They have absolutely no plans beyond the final show in Portland, Oregon, when Robinson plays on returning his full attention to the Chris Robinson Brotherhood.We spoke with Chris Robinson about the formation of As the Crow Flies, what fans can expect from the shows, the status of his relationship with Rich Robinson and his thoughts on a possible Black Crowes reunion. Tell me the backstory of this new band.For a long time I've been saying, no matter what it looks like, that I'm super proud and privileged to have been in the Black Crowes and write that music and perform that music. As an American rock &amp; roll thing, those songs are in people's lives. So it's always been there that those songs are there. I may be crazy, but I'm not that dumb, as David Crosby says. The reality is time and a few small circumstances [led to this]. I looked at our calendar because the CRB [Chris Robinson Brotherhood] is my focus and my life and our dedication and our spiritual practice. But this is the first year where I was going to have three months off with the CRB.It's been five years since I sang ""She Talks to Angels"" and five years since I really sang ""Thorn in My Pride."" As time goes by I'm like, ""Wow, here's a little period of time."" As things happen to me, they reveal themselves. I also did some acoustic shows on the West Coast, just me myself, the first time I really attempted that. I opened up my songbook and started playing ""Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye,"" and ""Oh Josephine,"" ""Hotel Illness,"" ""Jealous Again"" and ""High Head Blues."" And it really felt good. It was nice. They fit in well with the canon of songs I've done in my career.And then, another fortuitous thing was that I was in Nashville over the summer and had lunch with my good friend Audley Freed. It was a CRB show and Audley was going to come sit in with us. I said to him, ""What if we got together and jammed?"" Audley was like, ""It would be fun. I haven't played those songs in a really long time and I would love to play that music again."" So that was the seed and I was like, ""If Audley, one of the most accomplished guitar players in the world and one of my good friends, who I love and respect, if he's excited about it ..."" Then it turned into fantasy football. Lucky for me, the Black Crowes had a lot of musicians and I've maintained a lot of friendships. So Andy Hess, who played bass for the Black Crowes in the late 1990s, he could play bass. Then there's Adam MacDougall who plays with me in the CRB, was with me in the Black Crowes for a number of years. I'm obsessed with playing music with Adam. Tony Leone is my drummer for the last three years of playing on planet Earth, and as a singer, I'm not going anywhere without my favorite drummer, so he's in the band. Then the question is, ""Who can play this other guitar?"" We talked about a lot of people, but what's really exciting is having Marcus [King] come on. Me and Audley are in our fifties and most of the guys are coming up behind us and here's this kid that's a generation or two removed who is inspired and influenced by the same music that inspired and influenced us, which is part of the magic of being a musician. Then it was like, ""Cool. Here we are. We have a band."" Everyone is fired up.The other thing about this is it's only these shows. We're not going in the studio. We're not unleashing another leg at the end of this. It is just a little celebration of those songs with this group of people.Is the set list going to be just Black Crowes songs?We've discussed a few covers, but pretty much I want to just concentrate on the main Black Crowes albums, the songs that people will know. I'm not flogging away in the Black Crowes anymore, so there's a celebratory element to it. If I haven't sang ""She Talks to Angels"" for five years, I'm going to have fun singing it every night for a few weeks. I have this thing called the CRB that is my wild imagination, my adventure and everything is there. Like I said, we have three weeks off. The other guys in the CRB are busy, so it just was a perfect time.So come May 14th, the band is done?Yeah. It's there, I guess, so if we have a great time, we could do it again in a couple of years. But CRB are completely booked. After May, we go back out and do our thing. We're making a new record this year, so we're in the process of putting all the tunes together. So like I said, the time was right, the people are people I love and want to play with, so we struck while the iron was hot.Will the set list change much between shows?I think there are some pieces I'm going to want to play, longer pieces like ""Wiser Time"" and ""Thorn in My Pride."" I'd like to, since this is a different band and a different time, I'd like to do these songs, but have some places to let these people shine. I want Audley and Marcus to get down and get Adam in that mix. There's a lot of music. I'm definitely not playing guitar in this band. I'm going out as the lead singer, which will be cool too. It's been five years since I've up there just singing and putting my energies towards just that. That's something that'll be fun to get back into.You obviously missed singing these songs.The songs that you write, to me, that's the real jewel of the thing. That's the thing that's going to be here way after you're gone. If the songs resonate, then it says something about them. I think that's how I got into this world. This is what I dreamed about. If you can weave your dream into the reality of your life ... And these songs are the magic engines that run that dream. That's important to me.At CRB shows you'd play the Black Crowes songs ""Tornado"" and ""I Ain't Hiding,"" but not many others.""Tornado"" was the very first song I ever wrote on the guitar. That was kinda tossed aside by the Black Crowes. When we started the band we needed some tunes. Some of the other ones would be later Black Crowes songs like on [2009's] Before the Frost [...Until the Freeze]. I kinda felt like those weren't as deeply associated with the Black Crowes, where what I want to do with As the Crow Flies is beyond Black Crowesâ€“centric. I've made my commitment. I'm sorry there's not going to be any Black Crowes anymore. That's the way it works. Like I said, the CRB is the place for me to write new songs and have new friends in this new scene. This is just like, ""Hey, we can celebrate this. This music is still alive and well.""How does the ownership of the Black Crowes name work? Can one of you tour under that name without the other?You know what? I don't know. I wouldn't do that. I'm just kind of a weird person who likes to keep it in some sort of bizarre order, so I wouldn't have to ... The Black Crowes are all those people and this is something different.Do you still speak to your brother?[Softly] No.How long has it been?If we're speaking philosophically, it's been many decades.How about literally?In the physical plane? It's been about five years, probably.Do you miss him?I don't know, man. I'm busy, man. I've got stuff to do. All of us have our lives and I wish him all the best and I only want him to be happy, healthy and safe with his family and the people that he loves. Other than that, no. Like I said, I'm so happy and so busy and this world we live in looks so horrible and so ugly and so fear-driven that I'm so blessed to live in the republic of California and play rock &amp; roll music and live love and have art. On one side, yeah, it's kind of a bummer. But on the other side, the only thing we can control is our perception of things.How do you feel about the Magpie Salute, his own group that goes out and does Black Crowes songs?We've covered all that stuff. Your magazine is well documented in my opinions last year about that. But it's 2018 and here we are. Whoever plays guitar in whatever band you love, go see it. It'll make you feel better. Know what I'm saying?To ask the obvious question, is there any chance of a future reunion? Are the odds zero?I mean, the only reason I could see that â€“ I mean, the CRB is my life â€“ it would only be for money. This other world that we invented, and it only gets a little bigger every time we go out and make a noise, I'm writing songs, I'm doing everything I wanted to do when I got into this business. I had to go through some shit and break down some shit to get in here, maybe some people don't understand that, but the reality is that I love the Black Crowes. The best of that was great. The music was great, the concerts, the energy. But that was then. Now all my focus is in my consciousness and my subconsciousness doing all this other stuff. It's completely different vibes in a completely different time. I hope that it resonates in a positive, soulful way.Surely you're aware of all the Black Crowes fans still hoping it'll happen?Yeah. Totally.Do you feel sympathy for the fans torn between your band and Rich's band and just wanting to see you guys play together again?I'm so weird, man. I don't really think like that. People want Roger Waters and David Gilmour. Want me to compare it to them?Sure. As a Pink Floyd fan, aren't you hoping that those guys patch it up and find a way to work together?Like I said, I've been lucky enough to play rock &amp; roll for 30 years now. People are weird. One thing about me that should never surprise anyone is that I got into this because I'm a little weird. I say things other people don't say. I live the way that I live. I'm an artist. I didn't get into this to be compliant to some system that dictates that I'm supposed to only know ... or that status is important. To me, the only thing that's important is the work you're doing. I imagine that guys like Roger Waters and David Gilmour, no matter how legendary and iconic they are, they are the same thing underneath. You have the same set of guiding principles and things that you find to be right or wrong. I'm probably being more altruistic, in a way.It's the same with Led Zeppelin. They don't want to do it, so that's all there is to it.By the way, I've been lucky enough to be in a group with Jimmy Page. I love Jimmy. That goes in the history books of my life as an amazing experience, but also I've known Robert Plant longer. I've known him since 1990. When I saw him on tour a couple of years ago I was like, ""Here's a guy that's amazingly successful, but he's doing his own thing."" I told him, ""Out of all the people from our generation at your stature, you're one of the only true mavericks."" He was like, ""You know, fuck it. I'm gonna play what I'm going to play. I don't have to hang my hat on something that was for other people's reasons."" That's not negative or selfish or bad or arrogant. The guy just loves fucking music. When you love music, you gotta play it.But everywhere he goes, people are wondering, ""Do you think he'll ever do Zeppelin again?"" It's hard to escape that.That's why he doesn't do any interviews. He's said what he's got to say. If people can't listen, that's not his fucking problem. Like I said, the reality is that it's there for you to be a part of or not. If you're missing you because you're stuck in one thing then, wow, you could have added something to your life instead of being stuck.To get back to As the Crow Flies, do you think you'll break out songs the Black Crowes didn't play very often?Nah. I want to play the songs that everyone wants to hear. Know what I mean? I've thought about a few covers and it might be fun since Andy and Audley played with Jimmy [Page], to maybe throw a couple of Led Zeppelin songs in there.Is there any chance if this goes really well it'll become a secondary band for you and you'd even record new songs with them?You never know. These are great musicians, but Marcus has his career. Audley is playing all the time. Me, Tony and Adam are fully booked up. Andy has a pretty full dance card. As I said, we just want to get together and have a fucking boogie. If that is the seed that is sown, so be it. But we're in the middle of getting tunes together for the next CRB session. Everyone is busy. Like I said, when the world is full of chaos and doom and fear, people like us want to get down and do our work. Our work is positive work. It's not going to fucking change the world or anything, but it can get you through the night.&nbsp;As the Crow Flies tour dates:April 17 - Port Chester, NY&nbsp;@ Capitol TheatreApril 18 - Philadelphia, PA @ Electric FactoryApril 21 - Live Oak, FL @ Wanee Music FestivalApril 22 - Birmingham, AL @ Iron City BirminghamApril 24 - Chicago, IL @ Thalia HallApril 25 - Lexington, KY @ Machester Music HallApril 26 - Chattanooga, TN @ The SignalApril 28 - New Orleans, LA @ The Joy TheaterApril 29 - Nashville, TN @ Ryman AuditoriumMay 1 - St. Louis, MO @ The PageantMay 2 - Kansas City, MO @ The TrumanMay 6 - Denver, CO @ Ogden TheatreMay 8 - Las Vegas, NV @ Brooklyn BowlMay 9 - Los Angeles, CA @ The WilternMay 11 - Oakland, CA @ Fox TheaterMay 12 - Lake Tahoe, NV @ Montbleu Resort &amp; CasinoMay 13 - Portland, OR @ Crystal Ballroom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Mosi Reeves,2017-12-26T17:03:23.250Z,The Roots' Black Thought on How He Spit Nearly 10-Minute Viral Freestyle,"Black Thought, Black Thought Freestyle, Black Thought Funkmaster Flex,",Rolling Stone,"On December 14th, Black Thought â€“ the voice of the Philadelphia-bred band the Roots, and presence on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon â€“ reminded us why he deserves consideration on your greatest rappers of all time list. While visiting Funkmaster Flex's show on Hot 97.1 FM in New York City, the rapper dropped a stunning freestyle â€“ more than 2,000 words and nearly 10 minutes long â€“ that quickly went viral, earning over a million YouTube views in 24 hours. It sparked conversations around the Internet over the seemingly lost art of lyricism in an era described by some older fans as ""mumble rap."" In an interview, Black Thought â€“ who also frequently freestyles on The Tonight Show, spitting witty and charming remarks on the studio audience â€“ expressed surprise at the widespread acclaim for his appearance, and explained how he created his virtuosic performance.Were you surprised that so many people responded to your freestyle?Black Thought: Yeah, man, absolutely. You know, it's become pretty routine for me when I go to do interviews with certain people that it's going to be requested of me to rhyme: Tony Touch, or Statik Selektah, or Sway in the Morning, or sometimes the Breakfast Club, or Ebro [Darden at Hot 97]. These are all places where I feel like, as an MC, especially coming from my graduating class, it's safe to assume that they're going to say, ""Well, could you spit something?"" So I didn't expect any different from Funkmaster Flex. I mean, what I did is what I always do, but it's never been this well received. So yeah, it's totally taken me by surprise.Why do you think this particular freestyle went viral?I think hip-hop, the culture, is at a crossroads right now, and there's not very much that people who are older than millennials have to identify with. There isn't much that's reaching the mainstream that is hip-hop in the sense that people my age know it as, if that makes any sense. The game has changed. It's different. The standards are different, the criteria that's taken into consideration in determining validity is different. We're at a point in history where lyricism almost comes last in very many regards. So for someone from my school, who has come from the ilk of lyricism being held in far higher regard, it brings a different sort of urgency to every performance. That's what I went into that Flex freestyle with, with that same urgency that I had when I was a young person coming to New York from Philly with very much to prove.I think people had almost forgotten. Maybe not forgotten, but people had given up hope that someone out there was still around who is doing it the way we had done it. â€_ I mean, I'm not like a unicorn. There are very many artists who make those sorts of beats, and write and record those sorts of lyrics and performances, and carry that same cadence. But they don't necessarily have the same sort of platform [that I have]. How do you prepare for a freestyle like this? Do you memorize lines? Or do you generate lists of words that you can combine into lyrics?I think the definition of ""freestyle"" has definitely changed. When I was coming up, a freestyle wasn't a freestyle unless everything was completely improvised, in-the-moment and right there, and you had to incorporate various elements of what was going on in the room on the day. That's still a part of it. But I feel like it's evolved into something more, where you have to have the improv element, but you also have to have a certain script. As an actor, the theatrical side of me identifies with the concept of having a script, and memorizing the lines, and then being able to be ""off book,"" so to speak. If you know your lines and everybody else's lines, and you have those beats in your muscle memory, then you can improvise and go off-script. And if you reach a point during the improvisation where you feel like you're about to stutter or second-guess yourself, then you can immediately fall back on the part that you already know. So that's what [freestyle] has evolved into. It's like the new definition of freestyle. I mean, it still has to be witty, and you have to have punchlines. But in order to make it super dense, and incorporate all those layers of meaning and depth to the listener, it has to be both improv and muscle memory.Some people are debating whether your freestyle was improvised or pre-written. It sounds like it was a combination of the two.It absolutely was a combination, as it would have to be. I mean, I'm no superhero. I'm definitely an adamant professional, and I feel like I've mastered the craft. But it's just changed. If I were on Stretch &amp; Bobbito back in the day, like when I would go to their radio show and freestyle, everything had to be completely off the top. And, you know, I'm able to do that with the best of them. But in order to say what is needed, to get a rise out of young audiences, the 18-to-25s. â€_ You know, I have a couple of boys who are 17, 18 years oldâ€_and in order to get that sort of response from them, it has to be a combination [of improvisation and pre-written]. There has to be a research element involved. No public speaker or stand-up comedian, I mean, there's no one who's going to give a speech completely off the top without having worked on the beats, and how you're going to say what it is that you're saying, or worked on the tone.There were numerous topics you addressed during your freestyle. You talked about how the Roots' 1999 album Things Fall Apart anticipated the current political environment. You talked about growing up impoverished, and how you rose from those circumstances to win several Grammy Awards. How did you pick those topics?I feel like the performance is better received when I'm able to show vulnerability and wisdom, and not only winner-takes-all. I'm not only concerned with the braggadocio aspect and proving my lyrical prowess. That's a part of it, and that's a part that has to be spoken to as well. â€_ But at the same time, there needs to be a balance. So as I've matured, I've learned to give the listener, the audience, and my fans those glimpses into the inner workings of me, into what makes the machine that is Tariq Trotter. â€_ The same way that any speechwriter â€“ or Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock or Jerry Seinfeld â€“ will incorporate elements of their everyday life so that they resonate with their audience, that's what I do.There's a line in your rap where you say, ""Can't explain what these lame kids are talkin' 'bout."" There are folks debating that line. Did you call out the current generation of rappers?Yeah, I mean, some of the current generation, the ones who are lame. There are some millennial artists that I totally get and understand, and I know what they're talking about. People who I've worked with and who I'd like to work with. But there's a whole element of artists that I can't explain what they're talking about. And it's not just because of their stylistic approach with the whole ""mumble rap."" Lots of people are saying that I shut down mumble rap in one 10-minute setting. But that wasn't my intention, because mumble rap â€“ if we go back â€“ that's something I invented. I invented rapping without actually using the words. â€_ [W]ith songs like ""Don't Say Nuthin',"" freestyles like ""New Year's At Jay Dee's,"" I essentially invented mumble rap, where you go for many bars without saying any words. And when I did it, it came from a place of being inspired by scatting.Would you say the current generation's approach to rap is the same as what you've done?It's definitely different. I hate to keep using the term evolution, but I feel like it has evolved. The same way that all other pop culture has evolved into what we now know it, so has the music. Art, politics, everything must change, and everything has changed. But there's a way to embrace change and still appreciate and incorporate elements of the foundation from which it came.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,Barry Walters,2018-02-22T14:19:00.000Z,Madonna's 'Ray of Light': 6 Things You Didn't Know,"madonna, madonna ray of light",Rolling Stone,"Twenty years ago, Madonna was at a crossroads. After launching her Maverick entertainment company in 1992 with her widely but not wisely panned Erotica album and Sex book, the star entered a period of relative caution. The exuberant queerness of those works gave way to muted ballads, followed by&nbsp;Evita, which made her feminism palatable to Middle America. After the birth of her daughter Lourdes in 1996, she sought spiritual enlightenment in Kabbalah and Ashtanga yoga, and immersed herself in the work of songwriters who shared their secrets via meditative electronic textures â€“ particularly BjÃ¶rk, Everything But the Girl and Tricky.         All these factors shaped Ray of Light, an album akin to those artists' work, but also uniquely Madonna-esque. Rooted in the underground yet heard and loved by millions, it's the multi-platinum antecedent to today's popular EDM, but considerably more personal. Twenty years later, singers and producers alike are still chasing its finely finessed fusion of anguished rumination and beat-driven bliss. Rolling Stone spoke with key collaborators on this watershed LP. Here are six things we learned.1. Although the project's synth-centric final results earned her the passing nickname Veronica Electronica, Madonna didn't initially plan to work with songwriter Rick Nowels or producer William Orbit.After Evita, Madonna reunited with Babyface, co-producer and co-writer of Bedtime Stories' ""Take a Bow,"" which had topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks in 1995. But according to the smooth-soul magnate, ""Madonna didn't want or need to repeat herself."" Spotting her at Barney's department store when he'd come to Manhattan for the Grammys, producer and songwriter Rick Nowels â€“ now Lana Del Rey's primary collaborator â€“ impulsively introduced himself. ""I told her I was nominated for a Grammy for Celine Dion's 'Falling Into You,'"" he recalls. Much to his surprise, she replied, ""Oh, I love that song."" This led to a meeting at her home, where, according to Nowels, ""She said she had no idea what the new album was going to be."" At Nowels' Mulholland Drive home studio, the pair wrote nine songs in 10 days.""Until then, I had only written with friends â€“ Ellen Shipley, Billy Steinberg, and Stevie Nicks,"" Nowels remembers. ""It was quite unnerving to write one-on-one with the biggest star on the planet. But I loved her songs and felt an emotional kinship with her music. I got a lot of DJ records and old film score records and prepared loops to write to. Once the song was written, we'd drop the loop and program our own beat. 'Little Star' and 'The Power of Good-Bye' were written over a drum 'n' bass rhythm, which was happening at the time. 'To Have and Not to Hold' was written to a bossa nova beat."" Guy Oseary â€“ chairman of Maverick Records â€“ phoned synth-pop veteran William Orbit, who'd previously remixed Madonna's ""Justify My Love"" and ""Erotica."" Orbit's involvement expanded as the project evolved, although core Madonna associate Patrick Leonard and British producer Marius De Vries were both called in to assist as the album's creation stretched out over four-and-a-half months â€“ an eternity for the fast-working Madonna.2. Ray of Light is largely about spiritual transformation, but one song deals with the perils of hard drugs.""Candy Perfume Girl"" came out of a two-week writing and recording stint between Orbit and Susannah Melvoin, daughter of top L.A. session musician Mike Melvoin, brother to late Smashing Pumpkins touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin, twin sister to Prince and the Revolution's Wendy Melvoin, and former fiancÃ©e to Prince. She's no slouch herself: As member of the Family, a splinter group of the Time, she co-sang the original version of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" and co-wrote one of Prince's sweetest songs, Sign o' the Times' ""Starfish and Coffee."" According to Melvoin, William Orbit offered her some tracks to write melodies and lyrics to and sing over for what she thought would either become her solo debut or an album by Orbit's Strange Cargo project, which she â€“ and, it turns out, Madonna â€“ both loved.""I was on the floor [of Orbit's studio], just putting words together, and came up with 'Candy Perfume Girl,'"" she recalls. ""It was a personal track for me. At the time, I was mourning my brother [Jonathan died of a heroin overdose in 1996], and it was the allure of drug addiction. I was pretty jacked up about that record happening, and there were a couple of other songs that I had done with him there.""But Melvoin's publisher got a call notifying her that Orbit had offered Madonna the tracks they'd worked on: ""Candy Perfume Girl"" was going on the record, and Madonna wanted a third of the publishing. Melvoin maintains she also wrote the original lyrics to Ray of Light's ""Swim,"" which, she says were ""changed, but not significantly,"" as well as the original melodies, which she concedes were ""manipulated."" Yet in this case Melvoin didn't get credit or compensation. The songwriter emphasizes she has no beef with Madonna; she feels the superstar understood exactly what ""Candy Perfume Girl"" was about, and that she made a brilliant record. ""But had I gotten proper publishing on Ray of Light,"" Melvoin asserts, ""I wouldn't be worried about my financial life.""3. The album's defining techno-rock title track was based on an obscure folk oldie.Just as Orbit offered Madonna his Melvoin material, he similarly sent her a tape featuring unreleased work with Christine Leach, an English singer who'd co-written and sang with Strange Cargo. Leach's uncle is David Atkins, who, as Dave Curtiss, had been half of Curtiss Maldoon, an overlooked folk duo that released a pair of unsuccessful albums on Deep Purple's label in the early Seventies. The first one yielded ""Sepheryn,"" which Leach altered and sang parts of over the instrumental track given to her by Orbit, who had assumed Leach solely wrote what she sang. Madonna made additional changes, and the track became what we know as ""Ray of Light,"" which is credited to Madonna, William Orbit, Clive Maldoon, Dave Curtis [sic] and Christine Leach.Some elements ""Ray of Light"" are strikingly similar to parts of ""Sepheryn"": The opening vocal melody remains basically the same while the lyrics deviate only slightly. But ""Ray of Light"" omits the multiple tempo changes of ""Sepheryn"" while maintaining a steady rhythm. These changes appear in the Leach rendition leaked online. Madonna's interpretation â€“ which adds a crucial second, goddess-centric verse â€“ is certainly closer to it than to the Curtis Maldoon original, but Madge's way with the melody commands and sustains attention in ways that Leach's does not. Madonna and Orbit managed to turn a compelling experiment in transformation into the cornerstone of a whole album about radical personal and spiritual growth.4. Despite the borrowing, Madonna's Ray of Light collaborators consider the icon to be a top-level musical mind.Having co-written and co-produced significant chunks of many Madonna albums, including Ray of Light,&nbsp;as well as serving as her keyboardist and musical director on two major tours, Patrick Leonard has worked with Madonna longer and more extensively than any other musician. He also co-wrote and produced Leonard Cohen's final three studio albums, so when he calls her ""a helluva songwriter,"" it means something.""Her sensibility about melodic line â€“ from the beginning of the verse to the end of the verse and how the verse and the chorus influence each other â€“ is very deep,"" he contends. ""That's not common. Say 'Live to Tell,' for example, our first big single. The melodies I wrote are still there and she sings them for the most part, but it's where she departs from them that turned it into a song. Many times she's singing notes that no one would've thought of but her. Some of it can be perceived as naivetÃ© because she's picking a note you wouldn't choose. But who needs the 'correct' note? You need the right note that tells the story, and she's great at that. She certainly made me look better. All I have to do is look at all the other people I wrote with over the years and how that went.""Los Angeles-based cellist Suzie Katayama has worked with many big names in rock and pop including Roy Orbison, Neil Young, Prince, Eric Clapton, BjÃ¶rk and Beck. Her association with Madonna goes way back to 1986, and for Ray of Light, she conducted its strings and woodwinds â€“ 20 violins, six violas, six cellos, four basses, two flutes and an oboe.""It was a long day,"" she recalls. ""For that album, we did the orchestra in one day, both 'Frozen' and 'The Power of Good-bye.' That's why I don't remember much except for working really hard and fast. Everything that Madonna does, she is there. I have never been to anything that's hers that she didn't have the final say on it. She's hands-on. People can say whatever they want, but I remember when she did Dick Tracy, I had never seen anyone work so hard. I was impressed, and I think everyone was because she had to hold her own with a lot of people in that movie.""This was the record where I had more people calling me, saying, 'Whoa, this is a great record,'"" she continues. ""It was real musical. Ray of Light showed a side of her that I don't think most people saw.""5. One of the songs written but not recorded for Ray of Light&nbsp;was released years later by an Italian superstar.If you're not European or don't listen to Spanish-language radio, you probably don't recognize the name Laura Pausini. But the Faenza-born singer is pretty much a household name overseas, having sold more than 70 million records internationally. Her attempt to crack the U.S. market, 2002's From the Inside, flopped spectacularly. So for 2004's Resta in Ascolto and its European equivalent Escucha, Pausini returned to Italian and Spanish respectively, and together those albums sold more than 5 million copies, while the latter snagged both Grammy and Latin Grammy trophies. According to Nowels, their closing song, ""Mi Abbandono a Te"" (""Me Abandono a Ti"" on Escucha) was originally titled ""Like a Flower,"" and was composed by both him and Madonna during their Ray of Light songwriting sessions. Having re-written most of the Nowels-produced ballad's lyrics in Italian and Spanish, Pausini makes it her own. Nevertheless, the melody's melancholy Ray of Lightâ€“ness remains: The bilingual chorus couldn't be more Madonna if it poked you in the eye with a pointy bustier.6. None of Madonna's records won a Grammy until Ray of Light.The Recording Academy often rewards entertainers who release hit after hit, but this hasn't been the case with Madonna for much of her long career. In her first 15 years of releasing albums, she got a few scattered Grammy nominations â€“ including nods for ""Crazy for You,"" ""Papa Don't Preach,"" and ""Who's That Girl"" â€“ but her only win was for Blond Ambition World Tour Live, a long-out-of-print 1990 laser disc that's never been officially reissued on DVD or any other format.But Ray of Light significantly interrupted her losing streak: It won for Best Dance Recording and Best Pop Album, and the title track's promo clip won Best Short Form Music Video. Since then, she's won three more times out of 15 subsequent nominations â€“ including Best Electronic/Dance Album for her 2005 LP&nbsp;Confessions on a Dance Floor, which features a kindred mix of rhythmic extroversion and poetic reflection. Rather than throwing the Academy some deserved shade, Madonna, taking the stage in a flaming red Jean-Paul Gaultier kimono, merely thanked her collaborators before she yanked William Orbit â€“ who towered shyly above her â€“ down and toward the mic, chiding him for mumbling his gratitude: ""He does speak English; you'd never know it.""

13,Matt Diehl,2017-11-10T15:52:11.929Z,Agnostic Front Doc Shows a Band of Hardcore Brothers Who Never Gave Up,"agnostic front, agnostic front documentary, godfathers of hardcore, agnostic front movie, new york hardcore, ian mcfarland",Rolling Stone,"Agnostic Front were born in a war zone, and their music sounded like it. From its early-Eighties inception, the band embodied the violence, drugs and tragedy surrounding the New York hardcore scene it helped spawn on the city's derelict Lower East Side. It was unclear if the band would survive to play another show â€“ let alone evolve into one of the most unexpectedly influential groups of their era, still playing packed shows around the world to this day.&nbsp;That paradox lies at the heart of a visceral new documentary about the group, The Godfathers of Hardcore.&nbsp;Directed by Ian McFarland â€“ and receiving its theatrical premiere Saturday in New York as part of the 2017 DOC NYC film festival â€“ Godfathers trains an unflinching lens on this band's rise, fall, and unlikely rebirth. The doc acts as a dynamic, crucial companion piece to&nbsp;American Hardcore,&nbsp;The Decline of Western Civilization and&nbsp;other films chronicling the evolution of Eighties punk.&nbsp;The New York hardcore scene provided a home for the innovative thrash of the Bad Brains and even the young, loud, and snotty punk of the Beastie Boys. But with their leather-and-spikes tough-guy vibe, provocative embrace of skinhead Oi! music and political U.K. acts like Discharge, and the incendiary presence of frontman Roger Miret, Agnostic Front carved out their own lane. The band would become forefathers to the Nineties ""street punk"" explosion led by Rancid and the Casualties, and Miret &amp; Co.'s forward-thinking (and controversial) embrace of heavy-metal aesthetics would also prove inspirational to bands like Hatebreed, Killswitch Engage and Metallica.&nbsp;But as captured in McFarland's film, what's most impressive about the band is their surprising longevity and relevance. ""I'm 60 years old and I got a mohawk,"" exclaims Agnostic Front's original guitarist Vinnie Stigma, primping before a recent concert, in one of the film's many hilarious yet heartfelt moments.At the center of The Godfathers of Hardcore is the perennial bond between the band's co-founders Stigma and Miret. ""There's nothin' that could ever come between us,"" Stigma states to the camera, and that's clear from how McFarland depicts the primal relationship between the pair. Stigma was born and raised on a mafia-infested street in New York's East Village, and still lives in the same apartment. Miret, on the other hand, escaped Castro's Cuba to emigrate to the Eastern Seaboard, where he was raised in an abusive and broken home.&nbsp;What Godfathers powerfully reminds even Agnostic Front's biggest fans is what a through-and-through rock star Miret remains, even with a middle-age gut. With his movie-star looks and fearsome scream, Miret started as New York hardcore's poster boy â€“ its very own Chris Cornell, an artist just as pretty and tortured. As such, Miret would do hard time for drug dealing in the late Eighties â€“ an experience that, as the film shows, only strengthened his resolve and set the stage for his dramatic Nineties comeback.The Godfathers of Hardcore takes us from Agnostic Front's beginnings amid the junkies, street gangs and derelicts inhabiting New York's Lower East Side in the early Eighties right up today, as the band heralds its third decade with a new world tour. Some elements of the history could be more developed, such as the controversy over whether or not Agnostic Front endorsed racist views in their songs. (Godfathers&nbsp;demonstrably sets the record straight that Agnostic Front were the farthest thing from being Nazi punks, but considering the topic's relevance today, that part of the film could've gone deeper.) And that Steve Martin â€“ the PR guru to Radiohead, Paul McCartney, Beastie Boys, Jack White, U2, Arcade Fire and the late David Bowie â€“ did a two-year stint with the band in the late Eighties goes curiously unmentioned.But ultimately, The Godfathers of Hardcore does two things brilliantly: It vividly depicts how Stigma, Miret and their band members and New York hardcore co-conspirators were forced to forge their own surrogate family. At the same time, it demonstrates what happens when punks rise up from the gutter as they age and start conventional middle-class families. (The scenes of Miret with his children and wife in their suburban Arizona home are among the film's most affecting moments.)&nbsp;At the core of the film, though, are Agnostic Front's blazing, intensely emotional performances. Showing Miret and Stigma still hitting the road year after year, Godfathers proves in entertaining&nbsp;yet profound fashion that true punks remain hardcore even as they age. As Stigma himself notes in one scene, ""Once you're inâ€_ you can't get out.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,Kory Grow,2017-11-15T18:42:41.383Z,My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields on the Agony and Ecstasy of 'Loveless',"my bloody valentine,my bloody valentine interview,kevin shields interview,kevin shields,my bloody valentine loveless,loveless,isn't anything,my bloody valentine reissues,my bloody valentine vinyl,kevin shields guitar",Rolling Stone,"In the past few months, Kevin Shields nearly went bankrupt, as he pursued the seemingly Sisyphean task of making new, completely analog vinyl remasters of My Bloody Valentine's generation-defining albums, 1988's Isn't Anything?&nbsp;and 1991's Loveless. ""When we started, I was borrowing money from myself when I should have been paying tax bills,"" the guitarist and vocalist, 54, tells Rolling Stone. ""Instead, I was like, 'No, let's do this. It will only take six months.'"" It wound up taking roughly two years.It wasn't the first time he had to borrow money to fund his art. At various points in My Bloody Valentine's three-decade history, he and his bandmates have lived in squats and gone through penniless periods.&nbsp;Even as the band became one of the pioneering ""shoegazing"" bands, a group of late-Eighties British and Irish outfits whose music was so dreamy that they seemed to be hypnotized by it onstage, staring at their feet, My Bloody Valentine paid their dues. ""Everything I have ever done has paid for itself,"" Shields says with confidence in his voice. ""I've never made anything in my life that hasn't made money in the end. I'm not really worried."" And, he adds, ""A lack of money kind of helps in a very weird way, because we're not fighting over money because there isn't any.""Despite the appearance that My Bloody Valentine, whose members also include vocalist-guitarist Bilinda Butcher, bassist Debbie Googe and drummer Colm Ã“ CÃ_osÃ_ig, seem to have vanished since their last tour ended in 2013, with various members of the band exploring other pursuits, Shields reports the band is in a ""healthy state"" and has been working on a new, as-yet-untitled album due out by next summer. He's not sure how many songs will make the cut, but he's adamant that the group will be supporting the LP on the road next year. The most cumbersome speed bumps in following up their 2013 comeback album, MBV, have been the vinyl remasters. The project has become an urgent cause for Shields, since he's battled bouts of hearing loss throughout his career. By his estimation he needed to make these reissues before his auditory range would become too limited to be of any technical use. ""My hearing isn't gonna be really good in five years,"" he says. ""It's a downward spiral from now on.""He'd begun sprucing up both albums, as well as some of the group's EPs, in 2006 for the CD reissues that came out in 2012 but found the analog remastering process, which started in the summer of 2015, to be far more arduous than the digital one. It wound up consuming him, along with his wallet, as he immersed himself in the editing process and auditioned mastering plants since each, he says, has a unique sound. Now that the reissues are available for preorder on the band's website with a targeted shipping date in January, the typically reclusive artist tells Rolling Stone, over the course of a nearly two-and-a-halfâ€“hour interview, he's ready to return to Bloody business as usual. Even if he's still parsing what he just went through.""My attitude was, it's possible, so let's try it,"" he says. ""I don't think I'll ever do anything like that again, because it's not financially viable.""&nbsp;Shields sees the irony in Loveless overtaking his life again. The album, one of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest of All Time, took two years to complete and cost the band's label, Creation, a fortune that's become the stuff of rock legend. The remastering project cost as much as the original â€“ ""which is quite bizarre,"" says Shields â€“ but he underscores that the original cost only about Â£140,000 (as opposed to the Â£250,000 figure that bandied about indie-rock rumor mills at the time it came out). ""Plenty of other bands on the label spent a lot, and all bands on major labels spent double the amount,"" he says tersely. ""To me, all the financial details seemed to overshadow the record's artistic qualities. Why is that an issue? Do you know how much the Beatles' and Pink Floyd's records cost? You'd be shocked.""But where those bands had unlimited studio time and bottomless coffers, My Bloody Valentine spent months in and out of studios between 1989 and 1991 with more than a dozen engineers and assistants attempting to realize the album. ""A lot of people think Loveless was this long period of experimenting, messing around and going off in the wrong direction and starting again and all that,"" Shields says. ""It wasn't like that. It was very focused from the very beginning. We just had this extremely bad support network at the time. We had literally no money, and I was literally homeless, 'cause we lived in a squat and we got kicked out. There wasn't even 300 pounds available for [Creation] to get a deposit for a bed or something."" To make matters worse, Creation broke from a distribution and manufacturing deal with Rough Trade at the time, leaving the label financially unstable. The band had obtained a licensing deal with Warner Bros. in the U.S. and were able to bring in some cash that way, ""so it wasn't a terrible situation,"" Shields says, though the label wasn't paying the studio. ""We were at the first studio for two months, and the tapes were confiscated during the process of recording Loveless three or four times, and back in those days it was quite stressful because there's no backups,"" he says. ""It's just like, 'That's it. They have it,' just because there was no money around to pay the bill. So we started the record in a terrible place.""Creatively, it was a different situation. He'd gotten a vision for the Loveless sound in the first few months of 1989 and actualized it on his guitar by the end of the year. Where Isn't Anything? had signified an artistic breakthrough for the band, trading the jagged, confrontational sound of the band's early work with singer David Conway for clouds of impressionistic sound, Loveless&nbsp;presented Shields' new vision more holistically.Beginning with ""Only Shallow,"" Shields plays hefty, malleable guitar chords that seem to wilt and tremble&nbsp;around Butcher's vocals. There are hooks but no choruses â€“ just a sense of mood, like the aura preceding a migraine but without the pain. Each of Loveless' 11 songs presents its own shade of melancholy, coated in sugary keyboards (""When You Sleep,"" ""I Only Said"") and dense layers of grit (the guitar in ""To Here Knows When"" is so phlegmy it sounds like a transmission between two radio stations). Each song is like its own unique meditation, and to Shields' ears the analog remaster is the best representation of what he heard in the studio, though he doesn't dismiss the previously released digital versions since they provided different lenses to the Loveless experience.""Isn't Anything? is about humanness,"" Shields says, attempting to explain the moods of the records. ""Part of humanness is otherness, and Loveless is more otherness. The humanness is in there in the soul, but it's not obviously particularly human. It represented an attitude, and I did realize it reasonably correctly.""&nbsp;In some ways, My Bloody Valentine has been Shields' journey into finding the ultimate sound. He was born in Queens, New York, in 1963 but his Irish-born parents decided to return to their home country when he was around age 10. He met Ã“ CÃ_osÃ_ig while in grade school and the pair began playing together in various projects before forming My Bloody Valentine in 1983. ""The early version of My Bloody Valentine is what we became, which was basically fully experimental,"" Shields says. ""It was based around a 4-track tape machine, and we would improvise over that. Then we were getting into garage rock and the band the Birthday Party and playing simple music.""From 1985 to 1987, the band became more aggressive, sounding a bit like the Cramps, thanks to frontman Dave Conway's dramatic vocals. ""When we played live people would double-take, because on one hand, there were these quite poppy songs and played like a garage-band fashion, and we looked kind of funny with the haircuts and stuff, but it was quite painful to listen to,"" Shields says of their shows at the time, captured on the live LP The Man You Love to Hate. ""We used to boost [the frequency] three-and-a-half kilohertz, which is a really horrible frequency to boost. It was all a bit sick, really, and a bit odd.""Eventually Conway left, and they settled into the lineup featuring Butcher and Googe and began exploring sounds influenced more by the Smiths, the Cure and the guitar of the Byrds. To Shields' ears, his playing on My Bloody Valentine's earliest records represented a ""perversion of a guitar sound,"" meaning ""it's extremely clean, extremely small and just noise â€“ in a way not trying to be impressive."" Creation Records head Alan McGee noticed the disparity between the poppy sounds of their '87 album Ecstasy and what they did live and offered them studio time to make something that represented their live sound better. That's when they stumbled on the mixture of aggression and atmosphere that would mark their later works, beginning with the 1988 EP You Made Me Realise.""It was just us making music more as people, as opposed having a concept around it,"" Shields says. ""And then I did develop a concept again very quickly."" He laughs.Since most music in the Eighties was coated in reverb and studio effects like chorus and extreme stereo sound design, Shields thought the band should go in the opposite direction. ""My rules were no modulation, no big stereo panning, no trying to make everything sound like hi-fi,"" he says. ""I wanted to make everything sound like it was coming out of a ghetto blaster, just aggressive and the way I actually heard music myself most of the time when I would go to small gigs.""When you go to small concerts, it's not loads of bass and hi-fi sound,"" he continues. ""It's mid-range noise with everything fighting to be heard, and it's very exciting-sounding and I didn't hear that in music so that's why our records became quite mid-rangey. All the shoegazing bands that came after Loveless were using old production techniques. There's nothing weird or different about most shoegazers' sound. There's a lot of great things about those bands but I didn't feel very connected to it.""Shields' big inspirations around this time were American bands: Dinosaur Jr., some Sonic Youth and, ""particularly for me,"" Public Enemy. ""The sound on the first two Public Enemy records were very mid-rangey,"" he says. ""They weren't hi-fi hip-hop records. It wasn't music that was designed for an arena, and I loved up-frontness of that sound and the lack of attempting to pacify the listener with prettiness.""When My Bloody Valentine recorded Isn't Anything?, Shields' vision, much like Chuck D's, was to make everything as gritty as possible. ""We didn't use reverb or compression on the vocals, so they were very raw and strangely intimate,"" he says. ""I think a lot of people think the production on the album is bad compared to Loveless because it sounds so unproduced, but that was on purpose. If you listen to the stuff I did the year before, it was far more produced sounding.""As Shields played back the original Loveless tapes for his remastering project, he experienced a sensory overload. ""The exciting part is that a lot of the guitars, hearing them just in the album opening, they're what I kind of thought they were when I was doing it,"" he says. ""The sheer riffiness of that sound on the analog, without anything in the way, is quite special.""Ever since Loveless came out, Shields' guitar sound has been one of the most coveted in popular music. It resounds in unique places such as the fuzzy squelch of Billy Corgan's guitar on Siamese Dream (mixed by Loveless engineer Alan Moulder), the heavy dream state of Godflesh side project Jesu and the claustrophobic atmosphere of hip-hop group DÃ_lek's 2007 LP&nbsp;Abandoned Language. Even Phish's Trey Anastasio is a fan.The guitarists he looks up to most are HÃ_sker DÃ_'s Bob Mould, the Cramps' Poison Ivy, the Stooges' Ron Asheton and his all-time number one, Johnny Ramone. ""Guys like Johnny Ramone are like machines,"" he says. ""They're like aliens. It's not the normal rock guitarist expressing his ego onstage, not that there's anything wrong with that. When you play punk-rock guitar or sounds-based guitar, it starts to become more about your ability to transcend yourself.""When he plays, he says it's from a meditative state. ""You hear what you're doing and you are part of the sound,"" he says, ""and what you're doing physically to achieve that, you have to nearly separate yourself from it.""His big guitar revelation came when his friend Bill Carey insisted he play on better gear for You Made Me Realise and lent Shields a Fender Jazzmaster â€“ the type of guitar two of Shields' heroes, the Birthday Party's Rowland S. Howard and the Cure's Robert Smith, played. The whammy bar was set up in a way that he could make the strings shiver on the song ""Thorn."" ""The second I did that, something jumped inside me,"" he says. ""It was the first time in my life I could express my inner feeling in a way that my limited skill level matched to. It allowed me to play in a way where I don't have to think about what I was doing, I just feel it. It was like a stillness or an emptiness, so when I would be recording I wouldn't really see myself as a guitarist playing the music; I would literally be making the sound I was hearing.""That stillness onstage dovetailed into a phenomenon the British press called shoegazing, though Shields says for him it was more about concentration. Everything he was doing was so physical, coupled with operating the heaps of effects pedals he'd acquired (he points to a Yamaha SPX 90's ""reverse reverb"" setting, which he'd discovered via a Bob Mould interview, as especially important) that he was just trying to get the sound right. The reverse reverb was extremely sensitive to pressure, so he had to play really hard to achieve the ""totally liquid"" sound he desired. ""It was an expressive thing,"" he says. ""Somehow I could express how I felt in my stomach.""In the beginning stages of Loveless, he continued to experiment with effects and discovered Roger Mayer's Octavia pedal, a favorite of Jimi Hendrix's that shifted the instrument's pitch into tinny stratospheres, a bit like a sitar, or into gut-gurgling lows. One day while rehearsing with Ã“ CÃ_osÃ_ig, Shields made the pedal sound like a bomb exploding. ""We were in this 16-track studio that happen to open out onto an art gallery,"" Shields recalls. ""It was just me and Colm; he was on bass and I retuned all the strings so they were all really low and floppy. And we just turned it up and distorted it as much as possible to create this huge rumble. It was this immense sound, and we did it for about an hour. The lights in the art gallery were shuttering and it did occur to me that these paintings could fall because of the huge vibration. It just felt kind of childish and fun. After doing it we became sort of entranced. We stopped when it became too much, and we were just laughing our heads off. It was hysterical, a bit like an out-of-body experience. We found out that it had echoed all over South Kensington. ""The owner was about a mile and a half away and heard this crazy noise,"" he recalls. ""He came to the doors, but we locked them, and this guy was outside for 40 minutes, getting increasingly angry. He was screaming, furious with us when we answered the door, but we couldn't stop laughing. He couldn't be mad because he thought we were crazy.""The band later attempted the experiment in the middle section of ""You Made Me Realise,"" the music for which originally sounded a bit like the Beatles according to Shields, and including 20 minutes or so of noise to shake up audiences became a staple of My Bloody Valentine's set thereafter. It's something they'd previously attempted with a song called ""Clair"" â€“ ""We used to try and fuck students' heads up with it by never ending it to see if they would notice while they were playing pool,"" Shields says â€“ though in the case of ""You Made Me Realise,"" he figured it was something more physical that dovetailed into his Loveless vision. ""It's where our mantra comes from,"" he says. ""It's the idea that repetition is so overwhelming that you usually focus on the singing. But here you can't focus on it 'cause it is nothing."" The band scaled back the section on its most recent tours, but before that would give out earplugs to as many as 50,000 people if they were playing a festival.&nbsp;The senses are very important to how Shields experiences music. When he played the analog tapes for Loveless, he found that the experience triggered memories. ""In songs like 'To Hear Knows When,' the guitar sounds even more â€_ more,"" he says. ""It sounds on the edge of out of control. A simple way of putting it is when you listen to the analog one for a while, then you put the digital one on, it sounds crap."" The experience triggered memories of how he used to overpower tube microphones to get extra distortion for an effect a bit like the ""searing, ripping"" hiss and the subtle crackle of a fire, which he heard on early blues albums. But he also realized his memory of making the album was split in two. He had the sense of making the album â€“ the physical act of playing â€“ but also one of the finished piece, after he and engineers made digital edits to the music.Replicating those edits â€“ called digital crossfades, using computer technology of the time â€“ would become the most daunting part of remastering Loveless. A half-second change would take a surprising amount of time to complete, as Shields and compatriot Andy Savours built their own edit blocks and devised mathematic formulas to cut the tape. (Isn't Anything? was much easier to remaster since it already existed almost entirely in the analog domain.) Creating these techniques and executing them took the better part of a year. Shields was adamant that it all be done analog â€“ not because it's better, he says (""I preferred the digital version when we made it""), but because that's how he wanted to hear it â€“ and ultimately he enjoyed the sonic adventure. The final hurtle this time was in physical production. He found that manufacturers each had unique sounds. ""If you go to a French manufacturer, it's gonna come across a lot softer sounding and warmer than if you go to a British manufacturer, where it's gonna come across a lot more high end,"" he says. They eventually settled on a German facility because it was the most accurate. Throughout the process he went through various test pressings and later realized that full runs also sounded different, so they began doing short runs of 100. ""We literally have a few thousand records lying around,"" he says. ""All experiments and failures.""When he was auditioning manufacturers, he found that many seemed not to care about the quality of their product. ""When I played the original version from '91, it sounded more exciting than all these cuts that I was achieving now,"" he says. ""[The companies] just make vinyl and they take advantage of the fact that 50 percent of people who buy it don't even listen to it. And the other 50 percent are only getting into it for the first time. So you have a situation where only 25 percent of people can even tell if it's crap or not."" Repeatedly during the interview, he points to the Beatles' recent mono vinyl box set as one that was done right. (That said, he feels it may have fallen on deaf, or tone-deaf ears. ""The average Beatles fan is a fool, to be honest,"" he says. ""They couldn't tell the difference from a stereo or mono version."")While he's quite happy with the new MBV remasters, he wishes the whole process was easier. ""I do really admire people like Jack White just going off and setting up his own pressing plant,"" he says. ""That's a great thing.""Now that the remasters are being produced, Shields is ready to turn his attention back to a new My Bloody Valentine album. The band had begun work on new music last year, recording at studios in London and Ireland in spells, and the last time they worked on the music was about two months ago. They'd originally intended to make an EP, but Shields got a new concept. ""In some respects, some of it is a bit straightforward,"" he says. ""The MBV album that we did in 2013 feels more meandery and not as concise. This one is like if somebody took that and dropped some acid on it or created a dimensional clash or something. It's more all over the place.""He promises the new music fits into the My Bloody Valentine universe. ""Isn't Anything? is a kind of metaphysical record, very sexual, dealing with things like madness,"" he says. ""It was a like a diary of when we were living in squats. And Loveless was more intimate. And the MBV record was a bit like the end of something. It had a sense of nostalgia and yet it moved somewhere, and it had a sense of impendingness and looseness at the end. It's about death and change and what's happening in the world, as I perceived it in the late Nineties, and nostalgia is part of that. There's an attraction toward niceness and warmth but the change is cold and a bit hard, and now the world is perfectly in sync. The record I am making now is not so much about death and change as freedom of the soul."" The main delay in working on the LP has been Shields' hearing. ""My hearing feels like a scarce resource these days,"" he says. ""I know if I spend three weeks recording guitars, it literally takes me about two weeks before I recover and coax my hearing back into good shape. It has been that way for a long time.""Because of Shields' interest in analog recording, the album will be the length of a standard long player (about 40 minutes) and could be six or seven tracks, depending on what fits. ""It could turn out to be only five tracks,"" he says. ""I hope not, but I don't want it to be a double album and I don't want it to be really long.""Songwriting is a continuum for Shields. When asked if he was still using ideas he'd come up with after Loveless, during the wilderness years between the band's 1992 tour and 2008 reunion, he says he's still playing around with ideas he came up with on Loveless' ""To Here Knows When."" ""Until I'm dead, I will be exploring stuff,"" he says. ""It's not like I have an idea that I realize and go, 'OK, that's done, now the next.' It's more like a thing you explore and realize.""Shields' other concern lately is getting the business of the band in better shape. Even when reflecting on how money has ebbed and flowed throughout his career, including his recent spell of being broke, there's a note of astonishment in his voice when he says, ""We've lost houses of money because we insist on doing things in certain ways."" He'd like to see the band get a bit more structure on the business end sometime in the future. ""In the next year or two, I want us to be getting a bit more sensible without compromising things, just to see if I can be more productive,"" he says. ""We never had proper management, for example. People would often be surprised when they go backstage and there is nobody there, just the band. We're playing for 5,000 people, and people go backstage expecting to see people and there is no one, because we have a tour manager out front making sure our giant guest list gets sorted out properly so he's not even backstage.""One example of Shields' new M.O.: He says the band will definitely hit the road next year. ""It helps make the album; it helps realize it,"" he says. ""It's like with the MBV album; it would have taken another year if we hadn't booked the tour. It's no harm. It just means I go through a few months of hell. You work twice as hard, and that's OK.""When they released MBV, all they did was make a post on Facebook saying it was available. They didn't even have distribution in place. And while Shields says he has no regrets, he does want to do things differently. ""I don't want to release the album like we did it,"" he says. ""I want it to be more organized. I felt like we needed a manager, because we just react to everything. It worked well enough in the past, but I have to be honest. I don't do enough really to feel comfortable with the situation and I have been like that for a long time.""He recently collaborated with Brian Eno on a piece and found the experience inspiring, in that Eno had systems that encouraged spontaneity. ""My goal is to be more open-minded and create a thing where I am not compromised by the open-mindedness,"" he says. ""Sometimes open-mindedness is like saying, 'I don't care.' I learned from the Brian Eno experience you can completely care and still be completely fluid and open-minded.""When he looks at the big picture, though, he's satisfied with where he's at in life. Creating these remasters was an odyssey unto itself, and he's glad it's done. ""I did achieve something that I always felt I would, someday when I had the time,"" he says, beaming. ""And I did it."" That fact alone has helped him reconcile the project. ""People around me are a bit annoyed with me like, 'You have spent all your money doing this, and it's a calamity,' and I am like, 'I know,'"" he says. ""But I had to do it. I had to do it this time. I couldn't have done it in five years. I couldn't have done it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,Rob Sheffield,2018-02-12T17:49:00.000Z,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road: Why Rock Stars Are Suddenly Retiring,"elton john, paul simon, elton john retirement",Rolling Stone,"The rock world has never seen a rash of retirements like this. In the past few weeks, some of rock &amp; roll's most legendary performers have declared they're giving up the endless highway. Elton John announced his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, the final curtain for the ultimate showman. Paul Simon set a date for his last gig in London's Hyde Park. Neil Diamond, already well into his 50th-anniversary tour, immediately cancelled the rest of his shows on doctors' orders, after getting diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson revealed, ""We have no plans to tour or record any more. We're basically done. After 41 years, we felt it was enough.""The concept of ""enough"" is always exotic in rock &amp; roll â€“ but it's definitely a shock for so many legends to say goodnight at the same time. It's a historic moment where we're witnessing a sea change in how rock stars face their golden years. It's not like these veterans have lost their mojo â€“ anyone lucky enough to see Diamond last year can tell you he hasn't lost a step. And some road warriors still keep peaking onstage as they push 80, from Paul McCartney to Smokey Robinson to Bob Dylan to Fleetwood Mac. But for others, as Simon admitted, quitting feels like ""something of a relief."" So these elder statesmen are trying to invent something that's never really existed until now â€“ the rock &amp; roll retirement.It used to be that farewell gigs inspired mostly skeptical amusement. High-priced goodbyes are a classic show-biz trick; Cher's farewell tour is old enough to vote. But this time it's different. ""I'm not Cher, even though I like wearing her clothes,"" Elton John said at his press conference. ""This is the end."" He's not kidding. ""My priorities in my life are now my children, my husband and my family. I want to be home.""It's also the end of the line for Joan Baez, nearly 60 years after her 1959 debut. ""Number one: It's too hard to sing,"" she told Rolling Stone's Jonathan Bernstein in January. ""Nobody can really imagine the effort it takes to keep up with these vocal cords. ... I can't do shit in the upper range anymore."" Lynyrd Skynyrd just announced their ""Last of the Street Survivors"" tour â€“ 40 years after the band got wiped out in a plane crash. (Guitarist Garry Rossington is the only crash survivor left in Skynyrd. Fly high, free bird.) At 87, Sonny Rollins' pulmonary fibrosis has forced him to put down his mighty horn. Ozzy Osbourne, who quit with ""No More Tours"" in the 1990s, then surprised absolutely nobody by coming back for his Retirement Sucks Tour, will spend the next few years on his latest final trek â€“ with the tongue-in-cheek title, ""No More Tours 2.""Why now? Of course, the music world has lost too many legends in the past couple of years. But two deaths really seem to loom over this moment. Prince and Tom Petty were younger than most of the new retirees, but both died from the same painkiller â€“ Fentanyl â€“ after years of touring harder than their aging bones could handle. For years we all saw Prince work magic onstage nobody else could do; it wasn't until his tragic death that the world learned how he'd punished his body. Petty spent last summer on tour before finding out his hip was broken; the day he got the news, just a week after his final gig, he succumbed to an accidental overdose of Fentanyl, oxycodone, generic Xanax and other medications. Their deaths are a wake-up call for both musicians and fans. None of us want to see our heroes go out that way. It's no secret that the road takes a toll â€“ as Robbie Robertson said in The Last Waltz, over 40 years ago, ""It's a goddamn impossible way of life."" But the touring business is increasingly fixated on how to keep the old guys on the road â€“ in some cases, even after death. Elton John joked about asking his children, ""When Daddy dies, promise me there won't be a hologram of me going around the world doing concerts."" Yet even Elton â€“ a trouper who understands the show must go on â€“ realizes this might not be his call. ""Who knows? They may go broke and put me back on the fucking stage.""Randy Newman has summed it up perfectly: ""Musicians keep going. There is nobody applauding at home."" When the stars step back, it doesn't take them long to discover how much they miss the bright lights and rowdy crowds. ""My job is the greatest job in the world,"" Neil Diamond told an L.A. crowd last summer. ""I sing. You hear. You applaud. I sing louder. I go wherever the noise is."" Those of us who kept returning to see Diamond loved being part of that beautiful noise. We knew that if we showed up, he would too. (Just last summer, after years as a Neil-head, I finally got my first live ""If You Know What I Mean."" It was worth the wait.) ""I'm one of those people who would rather sit on the beach and do nothing, but I can't,"" he told Rolling Stone's Andy Greene in 2016. ""I'm addicted to the packing and the unpacking.""That's why the vets rarely walk away from the life, no matter how miserable it gets. They go where the noise is. The Who made the cover of the Rolling Stone in 1982 announcing their last tour â€“ ""before we become parodies of ourselves,"" as Roger Daltrey explained. My copy of this issue is older than Nicki Minaj, but the Who will spend most of 2018 out there in Oakland and Dayton and Rochester, rolling through ""See Me, Feel Me"" one more time. Who can blame them? Only a prude holds it against rockers who keep on keeping on. What else would you want them to do? For players and hustlers, tonight's the night. David Bowie seemed to retire every few years in the 1970s, making cheerfully insincere statements like ""I've rocked my last roll."" (As it turned out, he scored the final-curtain knockout of all time with Blackstar.) Eric Clapton did a solemn Rolling Stone interview in the summer of 2001, officially hanging up his keys to the highway. ""This is definitely the last time,"" he vowed. ""I get indigestion. I get tired. ... I can't play long solos anymore without boring myself."" God wailing ""Layla"" with heartburn â€“ who would wish that on anyone? So, crazy as it seems, most of us believed him, just as he surely believed himself. And needless to say, Clapton is playing European dates this summer after touring the U.S., Japan, Dubai and Thailand in recent years. The road goes on forever. But what we're seeing now is something new. Back before rock stars got serious about heath and fitness and sobriety, they weren't living long enough to worry about how to stop. Now some of them â€“ Elton for one â€“ hope to keep making music, without pushing their banged-up bodies on tour. Others are breaking their wands for good. Simon remains open to ""the occasional performance in a (hopefully) acoustically pristine hall."" Complaining about the sound guy at your comeback gigs when you haven't even finished retiring â€“ now that's peak Simon. In The Wild Bunch, grizzled outlaw William Holden wants to make one last score and then back off. Ernest Borgnine asks, ""Back off to what?"" That's the question that has kept driving rockers on the road, even to the point where it breaks them. Almost every veteran in The Last Waltz got back out there eventually, some of them dying there; now that Diamond has retired, nobody knows who'll end up the last one waltzing. (My money's on the stubborn Irish bastard in the sequinned pants.) But a generation of elders is searching for new ways to ride into the sunset, with goodbyes that do justice to their musical legacy as well as their audience. There's never been a template for how to abdicate â€“ rock stars have a long history of failing to figure this out, which is one of the traits that makes them rock stars. So it's a journey into the unknown. But for these performers, now's the time. Goodbye, yellow brick road.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Kory Grow,2018-02-12T17:01:28.284Z,Ozzy Osbourne Reveals Most Surprising Thing He's Seen on the Road,Ozzy Osbourne,Rolling Stone,"After spending much of the last half-century on the road with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist, Ozzy Osbourne will embark on a final trek around the globe beginning this spring. He's dubbed the jaunt the ""No More Tours 2"" tour â€“ a silly callback to his 1992 retirement tour, which lasted all of three years â€“ but this time he says it's not meant to be goodbye for good. ""I'm not retiring,"" the singer told Rolling Stone last week. ""It's 'No More Tours,' so I'm just not doing world tours anymore. I'm still going to be doing gigs, but I'm not going on tour for six months at a time anymore. I'd like to spend some time at home."" When he spoke to Rolling Stone, he had plenty more to say about the tour as well as his history on the road.What should fans expect from your final tour? [Deadpans] I hope a good show.Do you still get a thrill out of performing live? Oh, absolutely. Otherwise, I wouldn't do it. I'm a perfectionist in a lot of ways. If I drop a note, I'll get pissed off at myself. But I've got to try to get over that.You were very anxious the night of your first solo show in 1980, but were happy with the response.Every night before I go on tour, I get terrible stage fright until I cross that invisible line. Once I'm on, it's shit or bust.This tour will be ending in 2020, which is the 40th anniversary of your first album. Would you consider doing Blizzard of Ozz in full at any of these gigs? That was the thing for a while, to play the whole album, but I don't write albums that way, so no. When I make an album, I specifically record songs that I'll never do on the stage. Like on Blizzard of Ozz, there are songs that I wrote never to play live, because the production was too heavy. I always do a ballady song, I always like to do a rock song and I like to do what I call album tracks. And I'll do the ballady songs and the rock songs onstage, but the album tracks are just too over the top. But I suppose I could do one.How are you preparing for this tour? Well, I'm talking to you, ain't I? [Laughs]. I don't want people to get misled. It's not a retirement tour; it's 'No More Tours.' I just don't want to be on the road for the rest of my life. I'm married, and I hardly see my family. I go out one door, and my wife comes in the next. I just don't want to be that guy. When I'm on tour, I don't go out, because I'll get hassled. I'm not there to sightsee; I'm there to do work. And the best part of it is the gig, but then you've got to wait a few days to get that gig.It seems you just want to slow down a little more and enjoy life. That's exactly what it is. I'm blessed that I'm still doing it. I'm blessed that I still have a fanbase. And I'm blessed that I'm still passionate about what I do. Paul McCartney still tours. The Stones still tour. That's their choice. I don't want to be on the road all the time.What are your plans for when the tour is done? I'd like to make an album. I'll be doing gigs from time to time. I just know I won't be touring anymore.You've said you've got eight or nine song ideas. What kind of shape are they in? I've just got to sit down and work them out. There's never enough time in this house. And there's no time to do it on the road either. When I'm on the road, when I take a day off, I should try to rest my voice, so it's not a good idea to go and start singing and writing songs. But I've done that in the past.Over the last 40 years I'm sure you've seen some remarkable things at your concerts. What is the most memorable? There was one night when I saw that a bunch of people were not moving to the rock &amp; roll Â_â€“ and if someone's not moving in the audience and not doing anything, I'll do the show just for that person and I'll start throwing buckets of water at these people. Then someone told me the reason they're not moving or getting into the concert is because they're all deaf. And I felt like quite an idiot at the time, lashing them with buckets of water and hosing them down [laughs]. They were just standing there. Why does a deaf person want to go to a rock concert? I couldn't understand that. But I was told they feel the rhythm. It was quite interesting.I'm sure crazier things have happened. At every concert, someone gets arrested, I suppose. But I just get up there to give them the best night out I possibly can if I can do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,Kory Grow,2017-10-31T15:15:12.947Z,"Bootsy Collins on What James Brown Taught Him, Why He Quit Drugs","bootsy collins interview,bootsy collins,new bootsy collins,bootsy collins world wide funk,world wide funk,bootsy collins george clinton,bootsy collins james brown,bootsy collins drugs,bootsy collins bernie worrell,bootzilla",Rolling Stone,"There's a reason why the self-proclaimed ""world's only rhinestone rock-star doll,"" bassist Bootsy Collins, has taken six years to put out his new album, World Wide Funk: He was awaiting the urge. ""It's a feeling like you gotta release yourself,"" the typically hilarious yet surprisingly soft-spoken artist says. ""It's like going to the bathroom, man. You know, 'I gotta poop. I can't hold it no more.' I can't hold it, man."" Collins laughs at his own analogy and says, ""I probably gotta get out more often. I've been pent up too long.""Collins' scatological joke, of course, undersells World Wide Funk. The album is a continuation of the genre-spanning R&amp;B-funkâ€“hip-hop amalgam of his last release, 2011's The Funk Capital of the World, except with more focus on musicianship. In addition to a typically star-studded list of collaborators, including Snoop Dogg, Chuck D, Victor Wooten, Buckethead and Collins' late P-Funk associate Bernie Worrell, among others, he collaborated with emerging&nbsp;artists in an effort to find a new sound. ""I didn't want to make a record like I've been making before,"" he says during a lengthy, career-spanning interview with Rolling Stone. ""Everybody knows what to expect from me, so I didn't want to do that. I wanted to add a fresh, young energy to it, so I involved some young musicians and had them around me in recording sessions. I know what old funkateers wanna hear, but how do you get out of that if you don't want to just do that?""Collins says the experience of working with younger musicians like bassist Manou Gallo and guitarist Justin Johnson, helped him accept change, embrace new technology and ""open the mind."" ""They were wild and crazy about the opportunity to be with me,"" he says, ""and they're feeling like they ain't nobody yet, and I'm saying, 'You are.'""It led him to create the album's bluesy, country-flavored ""Boomerang,"" the upbeat jazzy dance number ""Snow Bunny"" and the rap-inflected modern funk of album closer ""Illusions."" To him, it's just a new extension of what the man known as Bootzilla has always been about. ""I don't want to leave all the funkateers hanging, so I'm gonna take 'em with me and I'm just gonna build on what we do,"" the singer says, with optimism beaming out of him. ""And then we'll all be out on the high sea, waving and funking and having a good time.""When you felt you were ready, was it easy to get started on World Wide Funk? Yeah. When I started the record, it just felt right. I didn't know what I was doing as far as what it was going to wind up being. But to me, the hardest thing to do in life is to get started. I grew up with brothers all on the street corner about what they was gonna do. And I was one of them. It just so happened that I learned early that I gotta turn this talk into doing something. My brother had a guitar and he wouldn't let me play it, so I knew I had to get a paper route and started saving my pennies; I started making $2.50 a week and I thought I was rich, man. The guitar I bought cost $29.95. You know how many months that took me to pay for that?About a year. Yeah.There's a track on the record, ""Bass-Rigged System,"" where you play with four other bassists â€“ Victor Wooten, Stanley Clarke, Alissia Benveniste and Manou Gallo. How do you pull something like that off? It's a thrill. My first concern was getting it down. I knew that if we started vibing, it was gonna go down and it did. At the end of the day it was, ""Let's see how we can place these things to make some kind of sense?"" There are gonna be people looking, listening to this and wanting to hear what so-and-so played, so I tried to do that part of it so people would actually hear what each one was doing. I love the album's ""Salute to Bernie,"" which features your recordings with Bernie Worrell before his death last year. What are your fondest memories of him? Probably a better question would be what were not my fondest times [laughs]. It was like he was the other half of you; he makes you a whole person. He made my music whole. He makes me feel like the part I don't have â€“ the technical part, as far as knowing what chords go together and how to read music â€“ he knows how to make what I play sound like I did on purpose.He complements you. Yeah, and he does it without questions. He never asked, ""Why did you do that? That ain't the right chord."" It would be like, ""OK, if that's what you wanna play, let me see what I can do to help it sound right."" He was always like that. He was just a joy to be around. We gained so much from each other.What did he learn from you? He learned that you don't have to be correct traditionally. Sometimes you can play whatever you're feeling and just make it work. I didn't know any better coming from James Brown's school; James just did what he felt.What are the biggest lessons you learned from James Brown? The most important one was that he told me I was too busy; I was playing a lot of stuff. He loved all the different stuff I was playing, but if I were to give him the one â€“ the one beat on every four count â€“ and then play all that other stuff, he said, ""Then, you my boy.""He treated me like a son. And being out of a fatherless home, I needed that father figure and he really played up to it. I mean, good Lord. Every night after we played a show, he called us back to give us a lecture about how horrible we sounded. [Affects James Brown voice] ""Nah, not on it, son. I didn't hear the one. You didn't give me the one."" He would tell me this at every show. One night, we knew we wasn't sounding really good â€“ we were off â€“ and he calls us back there and said, ""Uh huh, now that's what I'm talkin' about. Y'all was on it tonight. Y'all hit the one."" My brother [guitarist Phelps ""Catfish"" Collins] and I looked at each other like, ""This mother has got to be crazy.""  We knew in our heart and soul that we wasn't all that on that show. So then I started figuring out his game, man. By telling me that I wasn't on it, he made me practice harder. So I just absorbed what he said and used it in a positive way.Since we're talking about how you developed your style, I'm curious what you think of this. In George Clinton's book, he said that Parliament-Funkadelic found its stride when you played wah-wah style bass through a Mu-Tron on Chocolate City's ""Right On."" Do you agree with that?I think he's right, 'cause after we did that I felt like I had something to offer instead of just being a bass player. I felt like I had a signature. When we recorded that, it set a sound for us as a group â€“ as a band and I guess as a player as well.What was your process like back then? I believe ""Flash Light"" was a track you recorded with your brother. Me and my brother used to just put tracks together, 'cause George would always be the one to pick what songs were going for Parliament and what's going for Funkadelic. I had a handle on the songs I liked for myself personally, like for Bootsy's Rubber Band. But [Parliament-Funkadelic's brass section] the Horny Horns and my brother and I would just record tracks. So when we did ""Flash Light,"" I was in need of one other song on the Bootsy? Player of the Year album. So I recorded ""Flash Light"" and I recorded ""Bootzilla."" I happened to like ""Bootzilla"" for Bootsy's Rubber Band, because that was more the monster I was trying to create. ""Flash Light"" was more of a Parliament song, and George called it out: ""You know, well, give that to me."" So he took that and I took ""Bootzilla."" And they both were hits.You were talking earlier about the new approach you took on World Wide Funk. Will you be doing much of the older stuff on tour? I know I might have to do a few, but I'm gonna try to make sure they don't push me to do a whole set like I have been doing. I think this album is going to allow me to break out of having to do that. Because this ain't back in the day. This is a new day and the sooner we embrace that, the better. Being creative calls for change. If I did the older stuff, it would have to be moving forward. Just me being in the mix is old school enough. You're gonna get what I got in me. So I'm looking forward to the challenge.About 20 years ago, you told Rolling Stone, ""I got so tired of living up to that Bootsy character. I'd become a so-called 'star' and I just didn't know how to handle it."" How did you find the place where you're at right now? A lot had it do with time and a lot had to do with backing off ""Bootsy"" and becoming William again. I came home to see mama one day with all the boys and girls with me, and I had the star glasses on â€“ I was decked out with my leathers on like I was still onstage. I came home, and she slapped the glasses of me. I'm like, ""What was that about?"" She said, ""Go out there and take that garbage out, boy."" And I was like, ""Oh, man."" I was very embarrassed in front of all my friends. But I needed that. That slap right there let me know that when you come home, you take the glasses off. You ain't nobody but William here. And I had to realize that.A lot of things had to happen to me. I fell off my motorcycle and had a terrible accident. The doctors told me I wasn't gonna be able to use my right arm and I'd never play again. And that scared me to death. So that combination right there was enough to turn me around to say, ""Wait a minute. It's all right to be that guy when it's time to be that guy, but you don't have to be that guy at home."" I thought I had to be him 27 hours a day. That sounds like a hard lesson.It's like the Frankenstein monster: Once you get him up and rolling, that mother gonna turn on you. I had to accept that this was my fault. I'm the one that's out here crazy, doing all these drugs. 'Cause I didn't get into it just to do that. And I found out that I put more time into doing drugs and partying than I did making music.Did drugs ever help your creativity? Definitely, but I wouldn't say go out and try it. For me starting off, I was just adventurous. I was trying different stuff. LSD was probably the culprit for opening my mind to anything and everything possible: I mean the colors, the clothing, the self-expression, the whole love-and-peace thing. It had to be in there, but what I was doing helped bring it out even more. It pumped it up faster like a time traveler. ... It was the trip of a lifetime, and I think it worked for me. I felt good about it.What made you stop taking drugs? The motorcycle accident and the mother slap. And the other part was in 1979, I got on the SST [supersonic transport plane] going over to Europe. I had been wanting to fly on that thing. They had just came out. Everybody was telling us how quick you get there, so I had wanted to fly it. As soon as I got on it, 45 minutes into the flight, we lost all of the engines. So you're talking about somebody who's scared to death, man. Then we hit the sound barrier, and you just heard this big boom. I'm sitting by the window, 'cause I always sit by the window over the wing, and as soon as I heard the boom, I saw big flash of fire come from one of the motors. We were going straight down. You ever seen a plane coming out of the air? And not only that, I had just come back from the movies watching Jaws. I was like, ""Oh, my God, Jaws, I'm coming to see you.""Now put that together. OK, I'm gonna crash. Then if I ain't dead, Jaws is gonna eat me. And then one of the engines kicked back in and we were able to fly back to New York sideways. It was a crash landing, but we made it. And that was one of the incidences that helped me come off of everything I was on. I made all these promises to God, like, ""If you get me out of this one, Lord, help me. I promise I won't take no more."" I stayed off planes until I got with Deee-Lite in 1991. Everywhere I went between those times it was bus, a train or boat.I kept saying that for a while that it started like me crying wolf and then at some point I had to get serious. Whatever point that was, I throwed all my drugs away and I stopped taking them. That was in, like, '84 or '85. That's when it started to become clear what I needed to get back to, which was the music.That will definitely turn your life around. Yeah, it did. And I'm thankful. A lot of things that we think are negative to us help shape our lives. Like the thing James [Brown] was doing when he was saying I wasn't on it. That was a negative thing and that was why he was doing it to me. It helped shape my life and make me better. A lot of things come at you in a negative way and it depends on how you accept it and respond to it. It can make you a better person.What lesson did you take from that that you rely on today? I just wanted to play in the band. I didn't want to lead the band, because it took too much. All you wanna do is have fun with the people, and then it gets thrown on you to do this. It's like, ""Man, all I wanna do is just play music for the people. Is that so hard to understand?"" You gotta come up with a balance, because you have to do it all. I had to step away from it to find out how to do it. And I'm still finding out. It's something that you never really grasp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,Steve Appleford,2017-11-07T16:53:00.000Z,Inside Miguel's Political Awakening,"miguel, miguel prison, miguel politics, miguel adelanto, miguel schoolsnotprisons, schoolsnotprisons, miguel war and leisure, miguel now, miguel new album",Rolling Stone,"On a desert road hours northeast of Los Angeles, the singer Miguel stands on a small makeshift stage of wooden pallets in his first act of political protest. Across the street is the Adelanto Detention Facility, temporary home to nearly 2,000 federal immigration detainees, and where guards quietly watch from their trucks as a small gathering of activists and media convene for a dusty, roadside press conference.Facing the sun and wind in a military-style parka and shades, the singer leans into the microphone: ""My name is Miguel. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California,"" he says, declaring himself the son of an African-American mother and an immigrant father born in Zamora, MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico. ""I'm here to be educated more, and to hopefully ... shed light on the situation, to find some kind of solution and to bring change.""Standing nearby is immigration attorney Christina Fialho, an organizer of the press conference and that night's #SchoolsNotPrisons concert down the road at the Adelanto Stadium baseball field. The detention center, which advocates insist should properly be called a prison, is the largest for-profit facility in California, one of four across the state owned by the GEO Group, a publicly traded corporation. ""Its ultimate goal is to maximize profits for shareholders, which is usually on the backs of immigrants,"" says Fialho, who is executive director of Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants from Confinement (CIVIC). ""Sexual assaults are being perpetrated by ICE officials, by contracted facility guards, even by medical professionals in these facilities. For every 56 people at this prison, we receive at least one complaint of sexual assault,"" she said, referring to CIVIC's federal civil rights complaint.CIVIC filed a federal letter of complaint about the sexual assaults, based on data found through a Freedom of Information Act request. ""Our company strongly refutes these allegations,"" the GEO Group responded in a statement. ""The Adelanto ICE Processing Center provides high quality, cultural responsive services, including around-the-clock medical care, in a safe, secure, and humane environment."" Without specifically addressing the allegations at Adelanto, ICE spokeswoman Lori K. Haley said the agency ""has a zero tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse or assault,"" noting that detainees and family members have access to multiple procedures for confidential reporting of abuse, staff neglect and retaliation for reporting abuse at its facilities, including Adelanto. Detainees behind its walls are largely from Latin America, but also originate from Asia and Africa, landing in the U.S. not just for economic reasons but to seek political asylum or escape from areas controlled by criminal gangs. At Adelanto, the U.S. and California flags fly beside the corporate colors of the GEO Group. Its blandly modern exterior reveals nothing of the trouble inside, which has included three deaths in the past year, multiple hunger strikes, poor medical care and several suicide attempts just since December, according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times.""ICE takes the death of any individual in its custody very seriously,"" Haley told Rolling Stone, adding that the larger medical facilities at Adelanto means ""a disproportionate number of detainees with health issues"" are sent there.For Miguel, participating in the October 20th press conference and concert is part of a personal, slowly evolving engagement with the political moment, inspired by such musical heroes as Prince, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. ""They all cared. It's a human thing,"" says Miguel. ""They all pushed the boundaries in their own way. They all challenged us to look at things a different way. I saw that from the artists I love, and I decided I want to do that. To be an artist is to deal with what's happening in your time.""His upcoming fourth album, War &amp; Leisure&nbsp;is still overwhelmingly upbeat and concerned with the personal and romantic, but it also contains ""Now,"" a questioning socially conscious ballad in the spirit of Lauryn Hill and Sam Cooke. Accompanied by layers of guitar and heavenly, electronic sounds, Miguel sings:""CEO of the free world now/Build your walls up high and wide ... /Should we teach our children hatred?/Chase the innocent and shoot them down? ... /Is that the look of freedom, now?/Is that the sound of freedom?""Last November, at age 31, the Grammy-winning soul artist voted in his first presidential election. ""Politics, I didn't have a personal interest,"" Miguel admits. ""I didn't really care. What is my one vote? That was my attitude.""He liked President Obama, but didn't feel drawn to the political process until last year's rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. ""Watching him made me interested,"" said Miguel. ""It was also our peers, our conversations, and seeing people really get behind him who shared similar values."" Even after Sanders lost the nomination, Miguel stayed engaged through the general election.After voting, he spent election night with his fiancÃ©e at an arcade and played air hockey as the TVs slowly revealed the results, state by state. ""The shit started rolling in,"" remembers Miguel, who tried to stay positive until the results were clear. ""With the election going in a direction way unexpected, I couldn't take my eyes off it. I couldn't not pay attention now.""During the two-hour afternoon drive to Adelanto, the singer rides in the back of a black SUV with a bowl of vegan Mexican food in his hands. Outside his window, the California high desert rushes past, with miles of dry brush and Joshua trees and the occasional tract of farmland.He checks his cell phone, which displays a nuclear mushroom cloud on the screen. ""It reminds me, I wake up and go to war every morning,"" he says, ""and we all do.""For part of the drive, he listens to the latest mixes of War &amp; Leisure, due out December 1st, and finds more to tinker with. The album, he says, ""is more about the personal struggle to find our way in the middle of it all. Stay positive but be mindful. Not to ignore what's happening, but not to be bogged down by it and stop our way of life.""  In rural Adelanto, the night's short concert would include his first public performance of ""Now."" ""I just want to remind people that we all see and feel what you're going through too. We're not ignoring it,"" explains the singer, born Miguel Jontel Pimentel. ""You're taking advantage of people, and now you want to kick them out?""  ""For me this is all educational,"" says Miguel, with growing concern for ""the kind of people that are being deported and held in these places, in these private facilities that are really jails. It's fathers, it's mothers, it's people who are contributing to society. It's pretty fucked up, man.""  After the press conference, Miguel joins a group of immigrants and family members in the baseball-field locker room who share their stories of coming to America. There is the young Chinese man who spent years locked up within the immigration system, the man from Kenya who was abruptly transferred facility to facility and for years unable to receive mail containing his court paperwork, the young woman in tears talking about a father locked away down the road: ""My dad isn't supposed to be in Adelanto. He's supposed to be home.""  Miguel tears up. Then Carlos Hidalgo, 50, who has been in the U.S. since he was 11, describes a general sense of despair during his time at the center. Even laborers accustomed to hard work in the fields broke under the weight of detention. He turns to Miguel and says, ""I had grown men come to me crying â€“ crying because they need help. Calluses on their hands, wrinkles on their neck because they've been working so many hours in the sun, broken nails, broken fingers. Why is he here? Why is that person in such a position in a system that is supposed to afford us a lot of opportunities?""  At the baseball field, the #SchoolsNotPrisons concert unfolds with a series of musical performers to a small crowd of locals and immigrant families from across Southern California. The temperature hovers around 50, but when Miguel takes the stage, the young women and girls up front erupt with screams and cell-phone flashes.  Accompanied only by an acoustic guitarist, Miguel sings a stripped-down ""Adorn,"" among other hits, plus three new songs. Before he finishes ""Now,"" fans are cheering to its message.  ""That's where it's a challenge for me: All right, where do I exist in this now?"" Miguel says earlier. ""What am I going to do now? What do I care about now? As things change and we grow, our priorities start to shift. I think I'm taking the time to reestablish in my own mind what I'm really trying to do â€“ what it's all for.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,David Browne,2017-11-30T16:59:00.000Z,"AC/DC's Malcolm Young: Bandmates, Admirers Remember Group's Quiet 'Catalyst'","malcolm young, malcolm young death, malcolm young ac/dc, malcolm young acdc, malcolm young biography, malcolm young rolling stone",Rolling Stone,"""I've never felt like a pop star,"" Malcolm Young told Rolling Stone in 2008. ""This is a 9-to-5 sort of gig."" Playing with AC/DC, the guitarist stood in the back, stone-faced, holding down the rhythm as his younger brother Angus soloed and stalked the stage in his trademark schoolboy outfit. When the Rolling Stones invited the Youngs onstage for a blues jam in 2003, Malcolm at first refused. ""He said, 'I can't,'â€‰"" former AC/DC singer Brian Johnson recalls. ""There was nothing funnier than Keith Richards and Ron Wood trying to drag him up there. He did a bit of a song with them and then walked back to the amps. That's just the way he was.""But Young, who died on November 18th at 64 of complications from dementia, was as integral to the band as his flamboyant brother. Malcolm co-wrote almost all of AC/DC's unrelenting anthems with Angus (and singer Johnson or his predecessor Bon Scott), kept a watchful eye on their image and integrity, and devised many landmark riffs. ""Angus was the star, but Malcolm was the most powerful and most underrated rhythm-guitar player in the history of rock &amp; roll, period,"" says Tom Morello. ""That band is uncompromised in its power, and the reason is Malcolm and the way he played. It's the tectonic plate on which the AC/DC world exists."" Malcolm dropped out of high school at 15 and began working as a mechanic after the Youngs relocated from Scotland to Australia. In the early Seventies, he joined a band called, strangely enough, the Velvet Underground â€“ before he and Angus joined forces, first in the R&amp;B group the Marcus Hook Roll Band, and then the first version of AC/DC, in 1973. Although Angus would say that his brother could easily play lead solos, Malcolm preferred the role of rock-solid foundation, while serving as the band's driving force. As Angus told Rolling Stone in 2016, ""Malcolm was always one to battle through. He would look at me in times of crisis and go, 'We'll just go in and do some work ... write some songs.' He had that drive.""""Malcolm was the catalyst,"" says Johnson, recalling the writing sessions for his first album with the band, 1980's Back in Black, which sold 22 million copies to become the sixth-bestselling album in the U.S. of all time. ""He came to my room with a cassette and a legal pad and said, 'This is the rough music. Let's see what you can come up with.' I said, 'What's the title?' and he said, 'You Shook Me All Night Long.' I said, 'That's a fucking long title!' Malcolm gave rock &amp; roll a fist, a kick in the ass."" Johnson recalls watching Malcolm play ""Let There Be Rock"" as he went through two guitar picks just during that song. ""He was like a machine up there,"" says Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, who toured with AC/DC in their early days. ""He was totally serious, and he didn't make any mistakes. He was rock-steady.""Young's personal life could be less stable. In the late Eighties, his drinking got out of control. ""Malcolm had a problem,"" said his older brother George (who fronted the Marcus Hook Roll Band and passed away in October). ""In our family, if we have a problem, we deal with it ourselves."" Young got sober and, after missing a U.S. tour, returned to his rightful role. When Megadeth toured with AC/DC several years ago, Dave Mustaine glimpsed their less-than-crazy backstage life: ""Someone said, 'Can I get you a bottle of something?' and someone else said, 'All they do is drink tea and smoke cigarettes.'â€‰""According to Johnson, Young's dementia began to reveal itself when AC/DC started rehearsing for the Black Ice tour in 2008 and Young had to relearn some of their old songs. By the time they started cutting 2014's Rock or Bust, he wasn't well enough to contribute. Later that year, he was admitted to a nursing home in Australia. ""It's hard to communicate,"" Angus said in 2016. ""I do pass on messages. I let him know there are a lot of people missing him."" Recalling the close of the Black Ice tour, Johnson says Malcolm was committed to the end: ""We were in Barcelona the last night â€“ Malcolm still had a fire in his eyes you could spot a mile away. You couldn't take your eyes off him.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,Elias Leight,2017-11-07T16:30:00.000Z,"Inside Latin Trap, the Viral Sound Too Hot for American Radio","latin trap, Bad Bunny, De La Ghetto, Latin urban, La Ocasion, Hear This Music, Trap Capos, reggaeton, latin music,Hot Latin Songs",Rolling Stone,"In 2015, Jorge Fonseca, a veteran A&amp;R for Sony Music Latin, made a trip to Puerto Rico in search of new sounds. ""When you go to the island, the streets speak to you,"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""You hear the kids with the cars, and they tell you what's happening."" On this particular visit, he noticed something different blaring from passing vehicles: ""I started hearing less reggaeton and more trap.""Reggaeton has been the commercially dominant wing of Spanish-language hip-hop for more than a decade, launching global stars like Don Omar and Daddy Yankee. But a surging Latin trap sound is responding to more recent developments in American rap, embracing the slow-rolling rhythms and gooey vocal delivery popularized by Southern hip-hop. ""Latin music has needed something new and fresh for a long time,"" says Luis Rivera, Program Director for Latino Music at Music Choice, which controls audio and video content for cable TV subscribers. Despite being almost entirely shut out of American radio, Latin trap has taken off.Last year, Fonseca featured Puerto Rican artists like Anuel AA, Bryant Myers and Noriel on the compilation Trap Capos: Season 1, which became the first ""Latin trap"" LP to reach Number One on Billboard's Latin Rhythm Albums chart. Now a variety of artists associated with the movement are riding high: Five of the Top 30 music videos on YouTube's chart last week involved artists associated with Latin trap â€“ Bad Bunny, Chris Jeday, Karol G â€“ accumulating more than 170 million views total. Bad Bunny, the sound's best-known proponent, also appeared three times in the Top 25 of Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. Univision rolled out a trap channel on its app in January, and in April the Univision-owned X96.3 station in New York City started broadcasting an hour of Latin trap at night. Ismar SantaCruz, Vice President and Managing Director of Radio Strategy at Univision, estimates that the scene has quadrupled in size in the last year.""It goes beyond trap: the music we call 'Latin urban' is now diversifying into many different forms,"" says Horacio Rodriguez, VP of Marketing for Universal Music Latino. ""It's popping in the streets right now with zero radio airplay. It's a counter-culture of young kids listening to this music.""There's always been variety within the catch-all term ""Latin urban,"" but reggaeton has long been the primary money maker. ""An artist who liked rap would do a rap song and then three reggaetons â€“ that's on the charts, that's bringing in the bills,"" explains Messiah, the New York City-based Dominican rapper who calls himself ""one of the pioneers of Latin trap."" ""I grew up listening to hip-hop, so I always wanted to make hip-hop in my market,"" adds Alejandro ""Sky"" Ramirez, who produces for J Balvin. ""But I never got the opportunity, because it was not commercial. It had no possibilities.""Messiah saw a shift occur after he did a Spanish remix of Kazzie and Rick Ross' ""Yeah OK"" in 2014 and heard packed clubs rapping along to it. Last year, established star De La Ghetto released the smash ""La OcasiÃ_n"" featuring longtime collaborator ArcÃ¡ngel and young stars Anuel AA and Ozuna. The official video currently has over 418 million views.""When that song came out and the chorus was super catchy, this wave was here to stay,"" Rivera says. He introduced the first Music Choice video playlist dedicated to Latin trap this month.The underpinnings of ""La OcasiÃ_n"" will be familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of modern American rap. In place of reggaeton's signature beat, there's a lumbering bass, yammering hi-hats tapping out 32nd note patterns and a clipped, stupor-inducing keyboard loop. The young vocalists on the track easily blend singing and rapping, while the veterans stay closer to scratchy, declarative hip-hop. Both camps deliver lusty come-ons. There's even an all-star remix featuring Daddy Yankee, Nicky Jam, J Balvin, Farruko and Zion.DJ Luian, who co-produced the track, also runs the Puerto Rican imprint Hear This Music, now distributed by Sony Music Latin. He helped launch the career of Hear This signee Bad Bunny after he heard his single ""Diles"" on SoundCloud. Bad Bunny sings and raps with an unhurried, conversational tone; his ""Soy Peor"" video now has 330 million views. ""He can do a song with Drake; he can do a song with Travis Scott,"" Sky says of Bad Bunny. ""He is the guy to take this to another place.""Older stars have stampeded to endorse the latest style, boosting its mainstream exposure. The Colombian star J Balvin's Energia album contained songs like ""35 Pa Las 12,"" a booming, American-rap-radio-ready collaboration with the Dominican singer/rapper Fuego. The upcoming Farruko record is titled TrapXFicante. Maluma, a supple pop-reggaeton heartthrob, anchored the hook of the Trap Capos single ""Cuatro Babys.""Fonseca was gunning for a smash when he asked Maluma, who is also signed to Sony Latin, to participate in Trap Capos. ""We needed to make an international hit song â€“ we had to put somebody that was big on there,"" the A&amp;R vet explains. ""It was over when we put that song out.""Not everybody was enthralled: some denounced Maluma for singing about juggling four women who sleep with him on command. A petition on Change.org asked streaming platforms to remove the song from circulation because ""the lyric and the images incite direct violence towards women."" This month, officials in the Canary Islands revoked public funding for a scheduled Maluma concert, saying ""we can't support something with public money that denigrates women.""The controversy hasn't seemed to slow the spread of the music: ""Cuatro Babys"" is now certified quadruple-platinum. ""They wanted to stop it, but instead it just ended up getting bigger,"" Maluma says. ""I thought it was going to be a song that was just underground, and it became this worldwide sensation."" Responding to critics, he adds, ""At the end of the day, people are not obligated to listen to that type of music if they don't want to.""There is still one medium left to conquer: radio. Despite peppering the Hot Latin Songs chart with hits all year, Bad Bunny only just cracked the Latin Airplay chart this week as a guest on Becky G's ""Mayores."" Chris Jeday's trap-like ""Ahora Dice"" is one of the few in the style to appeal to radio programmers. Though Ozuna, another popular young singer associated with the rise of trap, has had success at radio, singles like ""Tu Foto"" lean towards reggaeton.""You and I could be having this conversation 15 years ago about reggaeton,"" acknowledges Victor Martinez, President of Hispanic Broadcasting Radio, when asked about the lack of Latin trap songs on the airwaves. ""It would be the same conversation: We have problems with the lyrics, with the raunchiness.""Radio has the doors open for [Latin trap] to come right in, they just have to help us out,"" he adds. ""The problem from my side is they don't put out clean versions."" However, sometimes radio takes matters into its own hands. According to SantaCruz, ""Cuatro Babys"" became so popular so quickly that his programmers crafted their own family-friendly edit.The massive success of the new wave of Latin urban artists have quickly earned the notice of American singers and rappers as well. ""We're already getting calls from mainstream artists that want to remix or work with our Latin trap artists,"" Rodriguez notes, and Maluma says he recently went into the studio with a number of American producers in L.A. Last month, PnB Rock remixed Bad Bunny's ""Soy Peor.""Fonseca is banking on the movement's continued growth and is currently working to assemble Trap Capos: Season 2. ""Music is not U.S.-based anymore,"" he says. ""Views can come from anywhere. A hit can come from anywhere.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,Andy Greene,2018-01-31T17:13:12.847Z,The Last Word: Chuck D on Why Rap Could Be 'the Blues of This Century',chuck d,Rolling Stone,"Chuck D has never been shy about sharing his opinions. From the earliest days of Public Enemy, the rapper spoke out about everything from police brutality to what he saw as systematic racism in American society. In the past year, he's had a new platform for expressing his views in Prophets of Rage, a supergroup he formed with B-Real of Cypress Hill and 3/4th of Rage Against The Machine. They are heading to New Zealand and Australia in March to kick off a long string of overseas dates, but before flying off he phoned up Rolling Stone for a Last Word interview in which he talked about Donald Trump, Barack Obama, his dislike of VH1 reality shows and how it feels to have been proven right about online music in the early 2000s.&nbsp;What was your favorite book as a kid and what does it say about you?It was a book about Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I pilot. It was an adventure, and it made me want to travel around the world.What movie are you able to watch over and over?Dead Presidents. I like the way that Larenz Tate throws the chair at the judge at the end. It shows the twisted hypocrisy of Vietnam and how the United States treated soldiers coming back like shit. Another favorite of mine is The Five Heartbeats. It actually depicted an era of musicianship that's under-heralded, black soul music of the 1960s. The movie shows all the crime and corruption behind it.&nbsp;What do you do to relax?Drive. The car is a pen and the road is a pad. As I drive, I'm singing songs, writing songs, playing songs, living songs.What's the most indulgent purchase you ever made?My house. But I've never even had a brand-new car. In 1995 I bought a 1994 Montero, but that's the closest I ever got.Who are your heroes?My parents. They gave me all the tools that it took to take on life. They taught me humility, what goes up might come down. They taught me how to deal with your lows as well as your highs.Describe your current fitness routine.Pilates. My trainer, Kathy Lopez, invented rap Pilates, which is kinda dope.What is rap Pilates?Everything is about core strength, which I need to be able to do Public Enemy and do high-octane shows with Prophets of Rage. Your power comes from building your diaphragm, having your cardio balance and eating right. But your core is everything.Tell me the best advice you ever got.A concert-promoter friend of mine, Darryl Brooks, told me, ""Don't look up at yourself on those giant screens arenas have, because your performance will be thrown off."" New performers would look at the screen and get enamored with their own image.What's your favorite city in the world?I've been to 107 countries, so I have different favorites at different times, but I'm forever amazed by New York. It's always shaping into something else.Do you think the New York of your younger years has been romanticized too much? Books and movies paint it as a golden period, but it was really dirty and dangerous.Yeah, especially as a black person. There was nothing to romanticize about a ripped-up, torn-down, burned-out Bronx. There was nothing to romanticize about a disenfranchised Harlem, a dirty Lower East Side. The beauty of New York is the people. The New York that's shined up and expensive now is a beautiful thing, but they forgot the people in the process. That's called gentrification.What advice do you wish you could give to yourself at age 20?You get out what you put in.What do you think he would say back to you?I would have heard it because I was always listening. The first superstar who told me anything was Rick James. He would put up the peace sign and say two words: ""Be safe."" Him and his whole band checked out one of Public Enemy's first shows with the Beastie Boys on the Licensed to Ill tour on a snowy day in Buffalo in 1987. He was one of the first artists that I was enamored about.Do the results of the Doug Jones/Roy Moore election in Alabama give you any hope for the future?My hope is the two party notion of Democrats and Republicans will be destroyed. They have a chokehold on the U.S.'s voting process. I would have voted for Cynthia McKinney and Rosa Clemente in 2008 if it wasn't for Obama, but I would vote for Cynthia McKinney and Rosa Clemente right now. Green party candidates.Are you at all surprised that a man who said African Americans had it better under slavery nearly became a United States senator?No. Why would I be surprised? That started when Sarah Palin almost became vice president.&nbsp;Are you able to think of anything about Donald Trump that you admire?Why? So you can take it out of context and say that Chuck thinks there are good things about Donald Trump? I ain't falling for that. But Tom Morello does say that bad presidents make great songs.Do you think that in twenty years America will be better or worse off than it is right now?About 10 years ago on Tavis Smiley, I predicted that America wouldn't be in one piece by 2050 and that it would be split up into 3 different countries. I still think that the United States of America has never really been united in the last 50 years, and it might be 3 countries by 2050 if there's still a planet.Are you surprised that things got this bad this quickly?Nah, I always paid attention to those people that voted against Barack Obama. It was 47 and 48%. I'll tell you this, that the media coming out of L.A. and New York, they are responsible for putting so many images out there that will fuel future hate.How?Look at VH-1. They put out so much shit that make black people look fucked. They give people a one-sided view about who we are as a people. They build up this animosity and hate based on what they see without even knowing anybody with those characteristics. So you got a country that judges us by our characteristics instead of our character. Because our character to them is on television or all these other forms of media that come across, even if it's online. It's like the cutting room floor is upside down for black people. Anything civil is on the cutting room floor and they push the other footage onto the world.""Apple hasn't called me up to work alongside them, so I don't have any feelings. Instead, they got Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. It figures.""How do you think history is going to remember Barack Obama?I thought he did twice the job as any other president because he had to. And he couldn't have no mistakes, no hiccups, never even look left or right, and he still got criticism.Do you think Trump will get re-elected?I don't think he will last his term, with health reasons just being one of them. He ain't a quitter, but he'll be forced to get out of there. And then we gotta face Mike Pence, who is a nightmare. Trump is a clown. Pence is a nightmare.&nbsp;You were a very early voice in favor of online music. Nearly everyone that took you on was proven wrong. Do you feel any sense of vindication?Well, Apple hasn't called me up to work alongside them, so I don't have any feelings. Instead, they got Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre. It figures.So no satisfaction from being right?It was already a leaning tree, so it's not like I was Nostradamus. I was a songwriter and I liked songs to live and breathe and get out. I didn't believe that a record company should prevent people from listening to a song. I didn't want radio stations or television outlets claiming exclusive rights.They really thought if they filed enough lawsuits against fans they could stop filesharing.They weren't music people. It was a bunch of suits.So many rap pioneers are flat broke. It's really a sad state of affairs.Yeah, but we have a chance to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. It may become the blues of this century where a lot of artists get their second wind and become the John Lee Hookers and Muddy Waters and Lightnin' Hopkins of this century. For rap and hip-hop, the right age might be 40 to 80 as far as your words having weight to change society. Younger people don't really know themselves or society. You have so many rappers like Eminem that are 40 and older and are like walking bibles.Is hip-hop still evolving in ways you find -interesting?Yeah. When you look at hip-hop around the world, you see that 33 percent of the time, women are involved. In the United States, it's five to 10 percent. America continues to throw women down a flight of stairs.Do you think the #MeToo movement will make lasting changes?As long as you're eradicating the male ownership andthe male stockholders. You have to put women in those positions and have it be50/50. Too $hort said the best thing recently: ""Y'all dudes just gottarealize that the old days is over and you gotta step aside. Women gotta runthings.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,Andy Greene,2017-12-14T14:19:00.000Z,"Hear Richie Sambora Talk Bon Jovi Hall of Fame Reunion, Relationship With Jon","Richie Sambora, Richie Sambora interview, Richie Sambora Bon Jovi, Bon Jovi Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, orianthi",Rolling Stone,"Richie Sambora suspected that Bon Jovi would get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when he saw that they absolutely dominated in the fan vote, but he didn't know for sure until his longtime buddy Steve Van Zandt called him up at 2 a.m. to deliver the news. ""He was like, 'You're in!'"" says Sambora. ""I was like, 'Awww!'"" We phoned up Sambora on his Hawaiian vacation later that day to hear his thoughts on the honor, his upcoming solo EP with partner Orianthi and the possibility of an onstage reunion with Bon Jovi at the induction ceremony.&nbsp; Listen to clips of the interview â€“ plus chats with Moody Blues' Justin Hayward and more about the future of the Hall of Fame â€“ in the latest episode of our 'Rolling Stone Music Now' podcast.How did you hear you were in?This has been in the wind for a while. And then the fans started ponying up like crazy. That's what we do this business for anyway. I've said this often: You can put on a show and if the fans don't show up, it's not a show, is it? The fans are just as important as we are, really. It's nice to know that you wrote some songs that really connect with people that they can take with them. What am I listening to? Otis Redding and the Staple Singers. Those songs affected me back in my life and now in this digital age you can reconnect with that and younger people can connect with these artists that are legacy artists. I'm not calling myself that yet, though!What was your reaction when you heard it was definite?Just gratitude, I guess. And going, ""Hey, I'm in the queue with Bob Dylan, Mick and Keith and Clapton, all my heroes and all the guys I grew up trying to emulate."" They are my heroes and my teachers. To be in that line is kind of surreal. I don't know if I believe it yet. It's that kind of an honor. It's almost not the institution itself; it's the pedigree of how people got there. To be a part of that whole movement and whole energy as things move forward is just tremendous. I have a lot of thanks for that.Why do you think it took so long?I don't know! I wasn't really paying attention. Honestly, I wasn't obsessed with it or anything like that. I didn't know when it was going to happen. I said, ""Hopefully I'll be alive."" A lot of people don't get in until they pass. The Songwriters Hall of Fame means a lot to me. I believe it's the foundation of our business, writing songs that connect with humanity and people all over. We happen to do that well. I ended up inducting Willie Dixon into the Songwriters Hall of Fame a few years back and he'd been dead for 40 years. He wrote all those amazing songs and I hope to be around to experience and enjoy the accolades or whatever you want to call them.I think a lot of old-school rock critics didn't like the band and that kept you guys out.&nbsp;Once again, my task was to do the best I could with the situation I was in. Look, I'm way happier doing what I'm doing now. Being in a band isn't the easiest thing to do in the world, especially when you're out there for 18-and-a-half months at a clip and life changes when you come back home. People are different. People get divorced. Life's tragedies happen to everybody. And life's joys also. You're out there performing as an entertainer. I always saw myself as a songwriting, entertaining motherfucker! That's my job. I love it. I'm in Hawaii right now with my family. I've been here for three days and I already wrote two songs. I'm working with Orianthi right now. Our next EP is dropping on Friday. It's been fabulous and been received pretty well. I'm very proud of the music we've made, working with our good friend Bob Rock, who is an amazing producer and we've sold 70 million records together, something like that.Do you think the band is going to reunite and perform at the ceremony?I would imagine so. Nobody has called me yet or anything like that, but I would imagine that would be the protocol. Don't you? I would think so. Of course, I'd be obliged.Do you think Alec John Such will show up?I hope so! Yeah, man. I hope so. He was my roommate, man. He was my guy. We lost contact with him a little while ago. He was always a ghost, man. He was always one of those cats that was a mystery. That was his trip and he held that mystique very, very well. He was the Keith Richards of our band. He's a cool, straight-up individual and I hope we get ahold of him somehow.When was the last time you spoke to him?It was a long time ago. We were playing a show and he showed up and came onstage and jam.That was 2001.A long, long time ago. And then the cat just disappeared. He's like a black cat, man. A black cat!Do you think that Hugh McDonald should be inducted also?Yeah. He's an essential part of this band. He's amazing and a dear, dear friend of mine. I met Hugh long before I met Jon. I was doing sessions and gigs and we'd just kind of run into each there and we became friends back then. He's essential, absolutely.Bands usually play three songs at the ceremony. Can you wager a guess as to what three songs you'll do?No idea. As I said, I haven't talked to anybody. I'm sure these conversations will happen. Personally, I'm cool. I'm easy. I'm happy to be there. I'm not worried about what's going to go on, really. I'm just going to say, ""Thanks a bunch."" Honestly, I'm glad I get to do what I do for a living. That's some crazy shit. Let's face it.It's you guys, Dire Straits, the Cars, the Moody Blues and Nina Simone. Are you a fan of all them?Yeah! I wish the Eurythmics would have gotten in. Dave [Stewart] is a good friend of mine. They deserve it. I'm surprised they only picked five, especially with a band like the Eurythmics and Dave being such a prolific producer and songwriter. I was hoping they were going to get in too.Are you able to envision a big all-star jam with everybody?Sure! Are you kidding? I'll play with anybody, man. We just did a gig in New York City with me and [Billy] Gibbons and Ori. I like to jam. I like to play with everybody. I just love working. As I said, we have our EP out on Friday and we just got done with this huge push of gigs, ending up at the Grammy Museum. We got a standing ovation and we played all new songs. It's about changing people's minds too. People just look at me like I'm the sidearm of Jon Bon Jovi and Ori's the sidearm of Michael Jackson. They don't know that we're songwriters and singers on top of that. The songs that we've written and that we go out and play ... it's surprising to me that people are surprised.Tell me about the songs on this new EP.We wrote like 70 songs and recorded 25. We have 25 masters. Now the way the business is, you have to put out a little at a time since people's attention spans aren't the way they used to be. We just decided to come out with five at a time.What do you miss most about being in Bon Jovi?I'm not really missing anything, to be honest with you. Listen, we did 31 years together and we worked very, very hard. I guess I miss the shows. I always say this to everyone: Making the music is the great part, the fun part, the part where you're trying to connect with people. It's the travel you get paid for, the 22 hours a day where you ain't onstage. That's what you get paid for. You miss a lot of life when you're on the road for most of your life. [Laughs] I just decided, ""I gotta get back to my family. I gotta get back to being an individual.""When is the last time you spoke to Jon?It's been a couple of years. There's been some texts back and forth. There ain't no malice or anything like that. It wasn't moving anywhere. 31 years is 31 years. That's a long time and being in a huge organization like Bon Jovi, it's all-consuming. You really don't have a chance to do anything else but that. That's where you are and that's it. It's some stone-cold stuff right there. That's it. You gotta move and roll with the punches, be flexible with the business, be flexible with the band; you gotta be flexible with your employees. It's a big job.I think the fans are going to be thrilled to see you back onstage with the band after all this time.I hope so. But you know what, even on this thing, everyone is always asking me about getting in and I said, ""I ain't counting on it, man. You never know what's going to happen."" I've been nominated for a lot of shit, a lot of awards. You know what? It's what you throw down every day and your sincerity is what matters. Anytime anyone comes to see me play now they can count on that. I am going to bring all the love and passion of why I started to make music in this life to that moment. Ori is the same way. You'll see it's real. That's what it is about. As long as you got that, you won't be afraid of walking in front of anybody. I'm always playing with Buddy Guy. I used to play with B.B. when he was still alive. I did the eulogy at B.B.'s funeral. I like to play with everybody, it doesn't matter who. You're going to call me up or if a new artist wants to work with me and write songs, do whatever, I'm always in. You just gotta be on a path to be the best you can be. I never felt I was in competition with nobody else because it's just the best you can do. That's how I see it.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,Andy Greene,2017-12-14T13:49:00.000Z,"Dire Straits Bassist John Illsley on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Reunion","John Illsley, Dire Straits bassist, Dire Straits reunion, Dire Straits Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, rock & roll hall of fame 2018, money for nothing, walk of life, dire straits songs, dire straits albums, money for nothing video",Rolling Stone,"Dire Straits went through a lot of lineup changes over their relatively brief time as an active band. Nine musicians joined frontman Mark Knopfler during the run, some lasting for little over two years. The only person to make it all the way from the first album in 1977 to the final concert in 1992 was bassist John Illsley. He started the band with brothers Mark and David Knopfler in 1977, and they remain close to this day, even though the group is little more than a memory by now. But they're getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year, and we phoned up Illsley to hear his thoughts on the honor â€“ and a possibility of a reunion performance at the ceremony. Congrats.Thank you. We're very happy about it.How did you first hear about it?Somebody sent me an email a while back saying we were on the list. I said, ""What does that mean?"" They say, ""You go on this list and people vote for you."" I said, ""Hang on, the band hasn't been doing anything since 19â€_ How is that going to work out? The Moodies have been touring in America for years. And Bon Jovi certainly has."" Anyway, there we are. All I can say is thank you very much to the people that voted for us. It's a great honor.How did you hear you were definitely in?Somebody from France, of all places, sent me an e-mail saying just, ""Congratulations."" I said, ""What are you talking about?"" It was as if I knew. The communication levels here are obviously a bit slow. They said, ""I think you've made it."" I said, ""That's very good news.""What was your first reaction?It was surprise, I think. I don't know why. It's a club that I've always looked at and thought, ""Hmmm. I wonder how you get into that one."" Now I know.I've always had the sense it's a bigger deal here in America than Europe. Do you agree?All I can say is that I've known about it for years, but I've never understood how it works. Really, I suppose, anybody that's been in the music business can get nominated. I don't know. It might be a bigger deal in the States. I really have no idea. All I can say is that I am very happy about it.There are taking in you, Mark Knopfler, Pick Withers, David Knopfler, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher. Are those the right people? Did they miss anyone important?I would say those are probably the main people who have made this thing what it is. But you can't do it without incredible good material, good songs. With Mark, we had a remarkable song master who could translate not just feelings, but ideas and circumstances to other people in a very clear kind of way. I think that's a very important aspect of it. In a sense, the band makes that happen in the way that they respond to the songs. Sometimes the songs would come to the band quite finished. Sometimes they wouldn't. Sometimes there would be a lot of different variations. You don't have the actual means of communicating if you don't have the songs.Do you plan on going to Cleveland in April for the ceremony?I will certainly be there, yeah. Definitely.Bands often reunite and perform at these things.&nbsp;[Chuckles]Do you think that's going to happen?I have absolutely no idea. It's all come rather sudden today. It would be probably a little bit difficult for me to say how that would work. I don't know. I don't know right now. We'd have to think about that and see how we do this thing. I couldn't say right now.They managed to get Led Zeppelin, the Police, Cream, Talking Heads and all these bands that hadn't played in years. It's often the one place where it does happen.Well, I think we'll just wait and see. [Laughs]How often do you talk to Mark?We communicate sometimes a lot and sometimes there's a break. We just communicate when we want to communicate, it's as simple as that. He's got a place pretty close to me in the countryside. When he's down I see a lot of him. I live out of London now, so that's my preference. We see as much of each other as we ever have. We're still very close and very good friends.Do you think he's going to be excited about this? Do you think he'll go to Cleveland? Will he even care?Oh gosh. You can't ask me that question. I actually put a call into him today, but I think he's in the studio so I haven't heard from him yet. I need to have a chat with him first so I can find out what his feelings are. This is kind of a one-off thing, an unusual conversation piece. [Laughs] It throws up more questions than answers, in a sense. It's very exciting. I don't mind the challenge, but I have to wait and see. He's pretty clear about most things in his life, which is part of the reason why he and I get on so well.How did you coax the band back together at your wedding in 1999? It's the only time you've played together since 1992.We didn't really. It was just Mark. He got up and played a bit with the band. I had this group of Irish musicians that I'd been playing around with for a bit. They were providing a bit of Irish music and I got up a did a few things with them. And then Mark got up a did a few things with them. It was a simple as that, really. There was nothing predetermined at all. I just made sure there was a proper guitar he could play and be able to use and an amplifier he could use. I just said, ""Do you want to get up and do something?"" If he'd said ""not really"" I would have said, ""OK, fine. I'll just carry on and play some Dire Straits songs for you."" Just joking. But he said he'd love to and he got up.Just speaking for yourself, you aren't opposed to the band playing at the induction, right?I think we'll just have to see how that's going to work. We're talking about a long time. David left the band in 1980. That's 37 years ago. Pick left in 1983. We're talking 34 years ago. It's quite a long time. There's a lot of water under the bridge, so to speak, a terrible British expression. A lot of time has passed. That's something Mark and I need to talk about and I'm not about to make any categorical [claims] right here. They'd obviously be unfair and probably misplaced and inaccurate. [Laughs]The night is going to be you guys, Bon Jovi, the Moody Blues, the Cars and Nina Simone. Are you fans of all them?I know all of them, of course. Nina Simone has been on my playlist for a long time, as has the rest of them. In a sense, I've grown up with the Moody Blues. In the late 1960s, I remember lying on my back and listening to ""Nights In White Satin."" The Cars, I know the music very well. It's a nice little group.Why do you think you were the one member besides Mark that managed to stick around for the entire run?That's a good question. I think probably because it sort of made sense, somehow. It's very difficult to analyze friendships and relationships, but I think that Mark and I had an understanding and a mutual respect and we felt that we'd created the thing in the first place. I think in all the time that I've known him we had one very, very small disagreement about something that was sorted out in about 35 seconds. Otherwise, we've just managed to agree about how the thing should work.You've got to remember that when a band starts to take off, there's a lot of energy going off. There's a lot of feelings of frustration and fear and wonder and ""can we make this happen?"" Suddenly, you're not playing in front of 500 people. You're playing in front of 5,000 and then it's 10,000. When things happen very quickly like that, you've got to be prepared for almost anything that can happen. I think that Mark and I were prepared for anything that could happen. Between the two of us, we were able to hold the whole thing together and make it work, in a sense. We ultimately decided to say, ""I think that's enough. That's very nice, thank you very much. Let's get out before we go completely mad.""Do you ever think the band simply got too big? You were playing soccer stadiums at the end. It couldn't possibly have gone beyond that.I don't know what ""too big"" is. I think you just get to the point where you're not sure where else you can take it. That probably happened to Zeppelin and a lot of bands. It doesn't seem to worry the Stones at all. They seem to keep crashing on. But I think theres's a point where you suddenly find yourself in a position where you don't really want to be there because you feel that your sense of identity is being compromised. Your sense of what's real is getting lost.How did you feel right after the band broke up? You were relatively young and suddenly the band is gone.That's good question. Even though Mark and I discussed it and we really wanted to put it to a close since the On Every Street tour [1992] was pretty bonkers. I had something else that I could go to outside of music. I paint a lot. That's my other life. I was able to channel all my energy into something else. I worked really, really hard at becoming a painter, which is what I do as well as play music now. It's become 50/50, painting and music. That filled my vacuum. It was a big vacuum to fill. You say ""I've had enough of this"" and one day you say, ""That was a big thing to give up.""But then you've got to take life as it comes. Life changes. Life moves on. Thankfully, I come from a pretty sound sort of family background. I met my present wife and we had some children and that filled a huge amount of the space. It's been beautiful ever since, really. I've been very fortunate to get to this particular point in my life and have my life still intact after having a remarkable experience with the Dire Straits situation.A bunch of former Dire Straits members toured as the Straits a few years back. How did you feel about that?Well, they were sort of members. It was kind of weird. If I'm perfectly honest, I wasn't particularly happy about it. They did actually approach me to front it. The thing is, I'd just come out of the hospital. I was quite ill. Apart from everything else, I wouldn't do it, but I wasn't fit to do it. But I said, ""If you're going to do it, will you please call it something else"" It would be like some people coming together and calling themselves the Stones or the Floyd. You can't really do that. You were members of the band for a while, but you don't own the name. You have no ownership. Can you please it call it something else? Call it what it is, which is basically a tribute act."" There's a lot of tribute acts. That's what happens when there's a vacuum. You just have to accept that, but I found it very difficult. It didn't last very long.The thing is, if a big band stops and doesn't do gigs anymore, then a lot of people are going to go around saying, ""This is an easy target. I can have fun with this. I can play the music and enjoy playing the music and pay for my beer on a Saturday night."" Everyone says to me, ""It's a compliment, isn't it?"" In some ways, it is a compliment. There's a lot of people out there doing this stuff. When I go out and play in Germany with my band I come across a lot of extraordinary names the Germans have made up to call themselves. The best one was Dire Strats. I thought that was fantastic. In a sense, you've just got to nod your head and go, ""OK."" It goads a bit, but it's not doing anyone any harm.Well, I guess I'll see you in Cleveland. I'm really hoping you guys play. It will be a nice way to end the band.Well, I should be there, that's for certain. What's it like? Tell me.It's Cleveland Public Hall, which is a really old building where the Beatles played. There are tables on the floor and fans in the seats. They serve a dinner. HBO broadcasts the show a few days later. Somebody will induct you, you'll give speeches and hopefully play. If you don't play, they'll probably get someone else to play your music.A tribute band!It'll likely be a major band that's been influenced by you.I was joking. But if anyone gets up and plays, I'll certainly be a part of it!&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,Jonathan Bernstein,2018-02-20T02:55:00.000Z,"Inside the Life of Brenda Lee, the Pop Heroine Next Door","brenda lee, brenda lee profile, brenda lee interview, brenda lee elton john, brenda lee rockin around the christmas tree, brenda lee taylor swift, brenda lee i'm sorry, ",Rolling Stone,"Brenda Lee is sitting inside her spacious Nashville home, sipping a glass of sweet tea and staring at dead friends. She shows off an autographed portrait of the Beatles from when the group opened for her at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, in 1962, then points to a wall, where a photo of a 12-year-old Lee dancing with Elvis hangs next to a framed gold necklace he gave her. Next, she brings out a commemorative brass coffer the King of England gave to Judy Garland, Lee's childhood idol and, later, her mentor. Was it a gift from Garland? ""I wish,"" she says, smirking. ""I bid on that.""Despite being one of the most successful American pop singers of the 20th century, Lee still looks up to her contemporaries as if she were an adoring fan. ""I'm an autograph hound,"" she admits. At the moment, she's particularly proud of a Fats Domino signature she received shortly before his death.Lee turns to another recent acquisition: a signed photo of Jerry Lee Lewis. The two of them toured the world together in the late Fifties and have crossed paths a few times since. ""I called up Jerry Lee,"" she recalls, ""and said, 'You know, as many times as I've worked with you, I've never got your autograph.'""Like Lewis, Lee is a living link to the dawn of rock &amp; roll, a member of a rapidly shrinking group that also includes Wanda Jackson and Little Richard. At 73, Lee is the youngest of those artists. They were all roughly a decade older than her when she began her professional recording career â€“ with a revved up version of Hank Williams' ""Jambalaya"" â€“ at the age of 11 in 1956.Right now, though, Lee is thinking less about her legacy and more about her left foot, which she broke recently and which is bothering her more than usual. ""With this darn big old thing I'm wearing, you'd think I broke my whole leg,"" she says, pointing to her ankle brace. Lee, who is only 4-foot-9, rises from her chair and hobbles over to some of her other treasures â€“ an autographed Taylor Swift guitar, a signed illustration of Elton John, a framed photo of Keith Richards' knuckly fingers â€“ before arriving at her most-prized possession. ""That's my graduation from high school,"" she says, pointing to her 1963 diploma from the Hollywood Professional School, an L.A. institution that catered to children working in show business.The prominent display of the diploma serves to illustrate a point the singer wants to make clear: Brenda Lee is normal. ""The thing about me is I've always led a normal life,"" she says. ""I'm probably one of the few artists that did.""If not normal, Lee is at least almost unfathomably levelheaded, a former child star who steered clear of the fates of, say, Frankie Lymon or Michael Jackson or her good friend Tanya Tucker, who could never avoid being in tabloid headlines. Lee's career has been marked by longevity, stability and, above all, sanity, despite a whirlwind youth that included poverty, tragedy and international fame, all before the age of 18.Lee rarely gets mentioned in the same breath as artists like Elvis, Johnny Cash or Muddy Waters, but in her prime, she was as popular as any of them. In the Sixties, she earned more Hot 100 singles in the United States â€“ 46 â€“ than any recording artist besides the Beatles, Elvis or Ray Charles, and she has sold more than 100 million records worldwide throughout her career.Listening to Lee's voice â€“ which blended the rural country-blues and gospel of her small-town Georgia upbringing with the sophisticated crooning styles of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett â€“ is like hearing the various histories of mid-20th-century American pop collide in real time. As the Fifties turned into the Sixties, Leeâ€™s manager, skeptical of rock and dismissive of the country-music market, pushed her toward old-world, night-club showbiz. After transforming from young rocker to pop balladeer, she scored more than 20 Top Forty hits between 1960 and 1963 alone.In England, meanwhile, she remained famous for her unhinged rockabilly act. Her early-Sixties tours in the U.K. featured the teenage singer running through ramped up versions of songs like ""Sweet Nothin's"" and ""Let's Jump the Broomstick"" with her Nashville backing band the Casuals. It was primal rock &amp; roll, unfiltered and filled with the type of abandon that Presley and Little Richard would become known for.""When I saw her perform, I was just stunned. I don't think I had ever heard anything like it,"" says Elton John, who was a teenager when he first saw Lee play in England. ""Brenda Lee is in the top three female rock &amp; roll singers of all time: her, Janis Joplin and Tina Turner."" John Lennon seemed to agree; he's said to have called Lee ""the greatest rock &amp; roll voice of them all.""Lee's hits became favorites of Elvis and helped lay the foundation for an entire generation of cosmopolitan Nashville country. Her music continues to leave its mark in surprising ways. Last year, Alison Krauss covered two of Lee's songs on her Top Ten album, Windy City.  Lee inspired both Kanye West, who sampled Lee's iconic ""uh-huh honey"" introduction on ""Sweet Nothin's"" for his 2013 hit ""Bound 2,"" as well as Taylor Swift, who has covered ""I'm Sorry"" and wrote an essay in which she called Lee â€“ one of her earliest idols â€“ ""the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak."" (The essay appeared in last yearâ€™s Woman Walk the Line, a book of personal essays about the most influential women in country music.)""Brenda is one of the greatest entertainers ever,"" says Dolly Parton, who's collaborated with Lee over the years and remains a close friend. ""But I think I like her mostly because she's the only person I know that I'm taller than.""These days, Lee describes her life as ""just the regular day of a woman that has kids, grandkids, a husband and a house."" She'll wake up early and do some chores, then fix lunch for her husband, Ronnie, whom she married in 1963, and her teenage grandson Charley, who lives with his grandparents alongside an 86-pound rescue dog they call ""Little Girl."" Today, Charley is running errands with Ronnie, who has worked his whole life as a general contractor in the Nashville area.Lee also remains busy with an ever-expanding array of duties and obligations pertaining to various organizations in Nashville. She is still constantly being called to appear onstage, host dinners, give speeches, sing at one-off events and induct fellow members into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Lee herself was inducted in 1997, just a few years before she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. (She is the first, and still - somehow - the only&nbsp;woman artist to earn both distinctions.)Lee serves as Nashville's unofficial mayor of sorts, having lived in the city for 60 years. Just about everyone in town has a Brenda Lee story: the time they ran into her at the grocery store, the time they interrupted her lunch at the Cheesecake Factory to ask for an autograph (she happily obliged), the time they helped lift her luggage into an overhead compartment.""She's a treasure here in Nashville,"" says Bobby Tomberlin, the Grammy-nominated country-music songwriter who has co-written songs with Lee. ""She's one of those people you see in the grocery store, and everyone just bows. Sometimes when I play a show in Nashville, I look out in the audience and there's Brenda in the audience, cheering you on. She's still a fan.""Today, Lee's schedule is as packed as it might have been 50 years ago: Later tonight, sheâ€™s hosting an awards dinner at the Musician's Hall of Fame; the following morning, she's slated to sing her 1965 song ""Unforgettable"" at a friend's funeral; later that evening, she's giving a keynote address for another local organization's event. ""In town, I speak more than I sing,"" she says.Right now, however, Lee is sitting among her framed photos of dearly departed celebrities and famous friends, trying to figure out why, exactly, she isn't more respected. Why, despite being one of the best-selling artists of the Fifties and Sixties, doesn't Lee get more credit as a rock and pop pioneer? Such a question, she assures me, wouldn't typically occupy her thoughts. Lee rarely thinks about her legacy; it is, in fact, at odds with who she is â€“ the ever-gracious small-town dreamer who has never taken an ounce of success for granted. ""I'm not used to introspection,"" Lee once said. ""I've never lingered on my feelings.""And yet, sitting for the most in-depth print interview of her entire career, Lee is in an unusually reflective mood. ""Sometimes I do wonder, what are the medals I have to show to get elected to the club?"" she asks. ""You wonder, 'OK, is that because Iâ€™m a girl? What is that?' I've never been able to name it or understand it. I mean, my record sales are certified, they're not a lie. They're not up for debate. I didn't do it, the Recording Industry Association of America did it, so blame them.""Brenda Lee Tarpleyâ€™s first official performance was in 1951, at the age of seven, when she won the talent show at her elementary school, belting out the country standard ""Slow Poke"" and Nat King Cole's ""Too Young."" Influenced in equal part by the gospel, country and R&amp;B she heard growing up, Lee soon began singing Hank Williams and Peggy Lee songs in talent shows and variety programs in and around Atlanta. She had already soaked up the vocal intonations of her heroes, and even as a pre-teen Lee could muster the world-weary authority of elders like Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly and Wanda Jackson. ""When I first heard her,"" says Elton John, ""I couldnâ€™t believe that that kind of voice could come out of someone so young.""When Lee was eight, her father, an alcoholic carpenter named Ruben Tarpley, died in a construction accident, an event that left the Tarpley family near-penniless and would alter the course of the child's life. ""When dad died, I know it had to have been hard on my mother, to have three children and to have to go work at a cotton mill 16 hours a day,"" she says, tearing up. ""It was never cemented in stone that we were poor, but we knew.""Lee's first huge break came in 1956, at age 11, when she scored a regular gig on the Ozark Jubilee, an influential country-music television variety program based in Missouri. That same year, she signed with Decca Records, and the family moved to Nashville. The next year, she recorded ""Dynamite,"" her first charting single, and the one that would earn her the nickname ""Little Miss Dynamite.""One year later, in 1958, the 13-year-old singer entered a recording studio to sing a recently written tune by the holiday-music songwriter Johnny Marks. ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" would eventually become Lee's best-known song, and, 60 years after it was first recorded, it remains the most enduring holiday song of its era. ""When we recorded 'Rockin,'"" Lee says. ""I knew it was magical.""Over the next half-decade, as Elvis joined the military, Little Richard returned to God and rock &amp; roll's first era receded, Lee emerged as a star. She had the unique ability to attract both teenage rock &amp; rollers and their middle-aged parents. On songs like ""Let's Jump the Broomstick"" and ""Sweet Nothin's,"" she seemed to channel a furious restlessness; other songs, like ""All Alone Am I"" and ""Emotions,"" communicated a very adult sense of loss. Just as often, she simply channeled an innate desire that transcended genre boundaries: ""I Want to be Wanted"" and ""I'm Sorry"" both became unlikely Top Ten R&amp;B hits in addition to topping the pop charts.In an era where male stars dominated the pop market, teen girls flocked to Lee. Not only was she their age, but she also appeared as one of their own, a girl-next-door who eschewed glitz and overt sexuality. ""My biggest gift was I wasn't a threat to the girls, or to their boyfriends,"" says Lee. ""They could come and cry on my shoulder, and I'd cry on theirs.""In her early torch ballads, Lee navigated complex and tortuous teenage emotions with a sophisticated sense of resolve. ""When she's singing sad songs, songs of loss, Brenda Lee is never weak. That's her message, underneath it all,"" says Alison Krauss. ""You always know she's going to recover, and you never feel sorry for her. Thereâ€™s never any hint of weakness.""Lee's earliest hit records beg the question: How could such a young child express the deep longing, romantic pain, and heartbreak of ballads like ""I'm Sorry"" and ""All Alone Am I""? Lee enjoys the mystery herself. ""I had my first single date when I was 18, and I married my date, so I don't have a clue where that emotion came from,"" she explains. ""I never kissed a boy. My mom didn't allow me to date.""Much of the intensity and longing in her earliest records, Lee says, was a result of her poor Southern upbringing. ""For a lot of us rural Southerners, like Little Richard and me, we somehow knew, even at our age, that this was our way out,""  she says. ""This was the way we could make life better for everybody around us, for our family."" She goes on to offer a rather fitting definition of rock &amp; roll: ""It's not an intellectual feeling. It was just a gut feeling that you know that things are not supposed to be quite the way they are, and that this might be the catalyst that gets you out. I didn't think of it that way until I got old enough to look back and see how hard we had it. I call it that gut thing that comes out, a feeling coming from your toes that just says, 'OK, this is it.'""Did the death of her father also give Lee access to the type of adult pain she expressed in her earliest pop hits? ""I think so,"" Lee says quietly. ""I think I put it into my songs. I think I did."" ""After my father died, it became necessary for me to help out,"" she writes in her autobiography. ""I was the only one making any money."" By the time she scored her first Number One as a 16-year-old, she was already providing for her mother and three siblings. Lee's domineering manager, Dub Allbritten, was convinced rock &amp; roll was a fad, and he encouraged Lee to model herself after entertainers like Sinatra and Bennett. Allbritten was a forceful presence; he discouraged Lee from listening to female singers for fear she would copy their style, and for the young Lee he represented a stern father figure whose approval she constantly craved. Allbritten was also a supremely successful businessman. He pursued international markets for Lee's music, making her one of the countryâ€™s first truly global pop stars, with mainstream success and Top Ten hits everywhere from Brazil to Japan.Lee rose to fame during a supposed dead-zone period of pop music, when, as the story goes, rock &amp; roll took the backstage to glitzy fluff in the years before the Beatles arrived. Lee became a bridge between eras, straddling the old world of showroom entertainment and the new dawn of raucous rockabilly release. She developed entirely different repertoires for her shows in the United States and the United Kingdom, where she was better known as the Queen of Rock &amp; Roll.In 1962, during a show in Hamburg, Germany, Lee was taken aback by a group of rowdy teenagers from Liverpool who were serving as her opening act. After watching their set, she approached one of them after the show. ""I've been meaning to ask you,"" Lee asked one of the young men, ""where do you get those songs?""â€œOh,â€ù replied John Lennon. ""We write them.""Lee and Lennon became fast friends during their Star Club residency. ""I hung out with John,"" she says. ""He was extremely intelligent, very acerbic with his jokes, just a gentle person. When I found out that they later said they were fans of my music, I was just floored.""When she wasn't hanging out with the Beatles or playing shows, Lee did her best to maintain a regular adolescent life. She attended Maplewood High School in Nashville, where she joined the cheerleading team. She went to class whenever she wasn't on tour, and stayed up on Friday nights talking about boys with her girlfriends. ""She fit right in,"" says her high school classmate Kay Smith, with whom Lee remains close to this day. ""She studied and took exams like everybody else. I'm not sure how she did it, but thatâ€™s Brenda."" But after ""Iâ€™m Sorry"" and ""I Want to be Wanted"" became consecutive Number One hits in 1960, Lee became a bona fide pop star, and left Maplewood for a school in Hollywood.She traveled tirelessly in those early years, playing two gigs a day and sleeping on an inflatable inner-tube in the back of a station wagon. ""Many times, I yearned to be with my friends rather than be out there on the road,""&nbsp;Lee once wrote. ""But I knew I had a family to support and that was the way it was going to be."" Through it all, Lee refrained from drugs and alcohol, instead indulging in more wholesome pleasures. ""It would just thrill me to death if weâ€™d play a state fair, because Iâ€™d get to go on all the rides,"" she says.  I ask Lee if spending much of her adolescence riding carnival attractions by herself in strange towns also got impossibly lonely. Lee pauses for a moment. ""A friend of mine was once going to Japan and he asked me, 'How is the jetlag?'"" she says. ""I told him, 'I never had jetlag when I flew to Japan.' He said, 'Youâ€™ve got to be joking, how is that possible?' And I said, 'Because nobody ever told me that I should.' To me, doing my shows and getting on my inner-tube and sleeping in the backseat and then getting up and doing it again, I didn't know anything else. I was getting to sing, and that's what I loved to do. So there were no complaints from me.""Expectations on Lee skyrocketed as she began to experience serious success in the early Sixties. ""I wasn't told every day that I could sing good, or 'Oh, that show was wonderful.' I was told, 'You should have hit that note, you can hit it, and you should have hit it.' I always got those kinds of remarks.""Lee continued to support her mother and siblings long after she attained mainstream success, although she was not generally clued in on her own finances. ""Nobody ever told me we had money,"" she says. ""So to me, the reality was to think, 'Well, if I donâ€™t make this gig, there might not be another.'""She barely even took time off to give birth to her first of two daughters in the spring of 1964: Before her baby had left the hospital, Lee was back onstage. By the time she was 25, the breakneck pace had caught up to her. In the fall of 1970, she canceled a series of shows after she was hospitalized for a week for what her spokesperson described at the time as ""nervous exhaustion."" Over the next five years, Lee underwent seven operations for an assortment of stomach and kidney problems, and suffered from a condition that caused blood clots.During the Seventies, she would nonetheless reinvent herself as a country star, scoring a half-dozen Top Ten hits between 1973 and 1975 with songs like ""Big Four Poster Bed"" and the Kris Kristofferson-penned ""Nobody Wins."" But by the end of the decade, for the first time in 25 years, Lee began to fade from the top of the charts.She remained busy in the Eighties, performing internationally and establishing a residency at Opryland. In the Nineties, she took up songwriting; her very first co-writing credit was a song recorded by Kenny Rogers. But these years also saw Lee spending more time at home, where she continued to amass, among other things, a sizeable dollhouse collection. ""You can make them what you want them to be,"" she told an interviewer about the dollhouses. ""You can have a kitchen with a lot of food on the table. You can have a daddy reading the paper in the living room."" In a different interview, she said, ""I think maybe Iâ€™m living a dream I had as a child about a happy home.""It's a few hours before Lee is supposed to be onstage, and her foot is still aching. â€œIâ€™m having more pain than I should,â€ù she says. Lee is slated to appear at the Musicianâ€™s Hall of Fame as the co-host of the Source Awards, which honor women who work behind the scenes in Nashvilleâ€™s music industry. Lee has hosted it nearly every year during the organizationâ€™s 15-year existence.Lee relishes paying tribute to these women, many of whom sheâ€™s worked with, and nearly all of whom would never be formally acknowledged otherwise. ""It's interesting to see ladies behind the power of the boys who make the noise on 16th Avenue,"" she says, referring to the former center of Nashville's Music Row.  During the second-wave feminism movement of the late Sixties, Lee was either on the road, touring incessantly, or at home with her husband and her two daughters. Did Lee ever identify with Sixties feminism? ""No,"" she says, before I finish the question.""My mother always taught me, if you don't really know something about something, stay out of it. So I never disrespected anything but stayed with what I knew,"" she says. ""They did their thing, and of course that's still going on, in a sense. At that time, so much was happening in the world. But I was raised to be and let be. And even though I was raised in the rural South, I was raised with a sense of respect for all of humankind, and for all people. And that, I think, will serve anyone well throughout their life.""Lee is proud of the ways in which she avoided being sexualized as a young female singer. She's dismayed, however, by the lack of progress in the world of country music when it comes to acceptance of women artists. ""You'd think that it would've changed some,"" she says. As ""the first rocker girl,"" as she puts it, Lee once experienced some double standards herself. ""It was hard being a girl back then,"" she says. ""Back in my day, boys didnâ€™t buy records.""And though she never dwells on it, Lee will occasionally find herself wondering if the reason her music isnâ€™t more appreciated is simply because sheâ€™s a woman. â€œI donâ€™t think Brenda Lee has been acclaimed as much as she should,â€ù says Wanda Jackson, who, like Lee, was a pioneer in the male-dominated worlds of country, rockabilly and rock &amp; roll. ""I would hesitate to put her in a box and say sheâ€™s country, or she's pop. I played a different type of rock than she did, but she was right there with all of us. She's a world-class, powerhouse singer.""Lee looks down at her throbbing left foot and starts thinking about the night ahead of her. She still loves the thrill of getting onstage, still performs a dozen or so concerts each year, but she also doesn't need the thrill to sustain her anymore. ""I do just enough to keep the urge from coming up, to satisfy my creative juices that I need to expose every once in a while,"" she says.Finally, less than a couple of hours before the award show begins, Lee makes a decision, the type of decision thatâ€™s taken her the better part of a lifetime to come to terms with, the type of decision that, in the old, breakneck days, would have been antithetical to the core of who she is.Tonight, she says, she's going to stay home.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,Jordan Runtagh,2017-12-12T18:32:22.892Z,Hear Paul McCartney's Long-Lost Experimental Christmas Mixtape for Fellow Beatles,"paul mccartney, paul mccartney unforgettable, paul mccartney christmas, paul mccartney tape loops, paul mccartney christmas mix, john lennon, beatles, beatles christmas, paul mccartney christmas tape",Rolling Stone,"For Christmas 1965, Paul McCartney presented his bandmates with a unique gift: a homemade record produced just for them, consisting of sampled songs, original sketches and avant-garde loops. ""Something crazy, something left field, just for the other Beatles, a fun thing which they could play late in the evening,"" he later said. With only three copies made, the discs are among the most rare Beatle-related collectibles. While these acetate pressings have almost certainly since worn out, an 18-minute segment of&nbsp;Unforgettable has recently surfaced, providing a glimpse of this experimental private mixtape from the Beatles' most creatively fertile period.&nbsp;For decades, all that was known about the recording were sketchy details provided by McCartney himself. ""It was called Unforgettable and it started with Nat 'King' Cole singing 'Unforgettable,'"" he explained to historian Mark Lewisohn in 1995. ""Then I came in over the top as the announcer: 'Yes, unforgettable, that's what you are! And today in Unforgettable ...' It was like a magazine program: full of weird interviews, experimental music, tape loops, some tracks I knew the others hadn't heard. It was just a compilation of odd things."" The unearthed portion includes an inventive selection of songs by the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, and Martha and the Vandellas, with McCartney assuming the role of a fast-talking New York DJ â€“ perhaps a nod to the so-called ""Fifth Beatle,"" Murray the K. At the time McCartney was living a central London townhouse belonging to the family of his girlfriend, Jane Asher. His tiny garret on the top floor, already crammed with gold records, instruments and other evidence of his global superstardom, now bore traces of his newfound fascination with tape loops. ""I used to have a couple of Brenell tape recorders,"" he told author Barry Miles, a friend from the period. ""I used to experiment with them when I had an afternoon off, which was quite often. [The Beatles would] be playing in the evening ... and there was often quite a bit of time when I was just in the house on my own so I had a lot of time for this. I wasn't in a routine. I could stay up till three in the morning, sleep through till two in the afternoon, and often did. It was a very free, formless time for me. Formative yet formless. I didn't have to be up for the baby, at that time there was none of that. So I would sit around all day, creating little tapes."" ""It was a very free, formless time for me. ... So I would sit around all day, creating little tapes.""In the room next door lived Jane's elder brother, Peter Asher, whose pop pedigree as one half of the hit-making harmony duo Peter &amp; Gordon belied an intense interest in avant-garde art. He provided McCartney an entree into London's underground music scene, exposing him to work by composers like Luciano Berio, John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. ""People were starting to lose their pure-pop mentality and mingle with artists,"" McCartney recalled in the Beatles' Anthology documentary. ""A kind of cross-fertilization was starting to happen."" McCartney would dub his own sound collages onto Philips cassettes â€“ a new innovation â€“ and play them at parties for particularly hip friends. ""It was really a kind of stoned thing,"" he told Miles. ""You knew you'd be round someone's house later that evening and if you had an interesting piece of music, it would be quite a blast, whether it be Ravi Shankar or Beethoven or Albert Ayler."" The process was so enjoyable that he toyed with the idea of releasing them as a solo album under the memorable title Paul McCartney Goes Too Far. Despite strong encouragement from John Lennon, Unforgettable would be the closest he ever came to such a full-length project in the Sixties. Though the Beatles' latest album, Rubber Soul, had only been released a few weeks prior on December 3rd, McCartney's gift was likely intended to point the band towards new musical horizons for their next work. ""It was a peculiar overall sound,"" George Harrison once said of Unforgettable. ""John, Ringo and I played it and realized Paul was on to something new. Paul has done a lot in making us realize that there are a lot of electronic sounds to investigate."" When they reconvened in the studio the following April to begin sessions for what would become Revolver, the first song they worked on was ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" built on a bed McCartney's tape loops.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,Erik Hedegaard,2018-01-30T16:35:00.000Z,The Sound and the Fury of Meat Loaf: 'I Am Not a Rock Star',meat loaf,Rolling Stone,"As it turns out, in the hill country west of Austin, in a big-ass house in a big-ass gated community, the singer known as Meat Loaf is hanging in there. He's 70. His hair is thinning, his hands are unsteady, his back is such a mess he can't get into bed at night without help from Deborah, his wife of 10 years, much less put on his socks and shoes. To get to the easy chair he's sitting in now, he had to plod along using a real-old-duffer's walker. It all pretty much sucks. ""And because it hurts my back, I haven't been able to sing in a year,"" he says. ""You use everything to sing, and I just cannot do it.""He takes a swig of sparkling water, eases himself back in his chair and looks miserable. And miserable is not how you want Meat Loaf to look. You want him to look all fat and sweaty â€“ great masses of hair flopping back and forth, eyeballs bulging right out of their sockets, voice soaring to hammy operatic heights â€“ more or less just as he did back in 1977 with the release of his debut album, Bat Out of Hell (and its two greatest, most bombastic, over-the-top songs, ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light"" and ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad""), which went on to sell more than 40 million copies and is now marking its 40th glorious anniversary, despite most rock critics hating it (and this magazine calling it ""mannered and derivative,"" full of puerile comic-book ""pretensions""). That's how you want to see him. A born-to-lose Texas redneck who teamed up with a genius-type songwriter-producer named Jim Steinman and beat the odds to become a rock star, a fine bit-part movie actor and a temper-tantrum-thrower of some renown. So, it just doesn't seem right to see him here like this. It's a real bummer.Anyway, with singing and touring out of the question, what he mostly does these days is watch reruns of Blue Bloods and Law &amp; Order. Or he loses himself in an online role-playing game called Gladiator (""It stops my brain from thinking""). Or he starts detailing the particulars of his various surgeries (""Now, the first back surgery was to remove an arachnoid cyst, which looks like an alien in my spinal canal.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.""). Or he kibitzes with people on his Facebook page, where if you tick him off, you better watch out, because he can spew with the best of them. ""Sorry you are so jaded, tired, bored, lacking enthusiasm, surfeited, sated, satiated, glutted, dulled, blunted, deadened, inured, tired, weary, wearied, unmoved, blasÃ©, and apathetic,"" he recently wrote, in response to a critic. ""It is a shame that your life has led you down this road.""He also tends to get upset when anyone dares to say that his voice isn't what it once was, if they cite, for example, the 2016 show in Canada during which he passed out, back pain shooting through him ""like a sword,"" with him dropping the mic to the ground, after which his voice seemed to warble along on its own, disembodied, suggesting that he'd been lip-syncing.""Morons!"" he says. ""I'm going, 'Before you make a comment, learn something about music. Learn something about tone.' People saying, 'You can't sing anymore.' I mean, OK, I can't get up to the B's anymore, but I can still hit the high C's, and A is a really strong note, too."" He goes on, ""In my music, nothing is blues-based. Everyone else, their songs are an octave, an octave and a half, that's as high as they get."" He snorts, scoffs. ""Yeah, man, I'm at two and a half, sometimes three and a half. The main thing that's different now is the tone of my voice. They call it flat or out of key. It's not. It's just that my tone is completely different from what it was, and there's nothing I can do about it.""He pauses, takes a deep breath and says, ""Those Facebook people, man, you know, yeah, I get upset.""And that, in fact, is one of the great things about Loaf. He's always getting riled up about something, which was most infamously seen during his 2011 stint on Celebrity Apprentice, when he got into it with hapless Gary Busey over some purloined paints â€“ they had been tasked with creating original art to be sold at a gallery â€“ and went into an apoplectic rage, shouting, ""OK! Motherfucker! I bought those motherfucking paints!,"" a grand bit of theater that went on for a full five ratings-boosting minutes.""Well,"" he says today, somewhat sheepishly, ""I'm not an internal guy. You piss me off, you're gonna know it.""At the same time, he's a well-known softy who seems to spend half his days in tears. A girl gets kidnapped on some TV show, he cries. A record-company exec gives him a Babe Ruth autograph, he cries. Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell, which was 16 years in the making, debuts at Number Three, he cries. Whitney Houston dies, he cries. His team wins on Celebrity Apprentice, he cries. He's an equal-opportunity weeper. ""Oh, I cry all the time,"" he says. ""I mean, I'll even cry about dog commercials. It's stupid.""It's not stupid, of course. It's just another side of the guy, just as there's the side that won't go to an upcoming premiere of the Bat Out of Hell stage musical if he has to use the walker (""Not a prayer""), and the side that doesn't want to go out, period. ""I don't have any business going out to where all the bars and bands are. They'd look at me and say, 'Who's the old guy? What's that old guy doing here?' No, man, I don't belong in those places.""So this is how Loaf lives today. This is what's become of him after 50 years in the rock &amp; roll business. But, in a sense, that's OK, because it's a miracle he got this far at all.As an actor,&nbsp;Loaf has appeared in 50-plus movies, starting with The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975, as Eddie, the greasy biker), moving through Fight Club (1999, as Bob, a fatty known for his ""bitch tits""), thence to Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006, as Jack Black's dad), and along the way flinging himself into TV shows like Tales From the Crypt (1992), Monk (2009) and Glee (2010). He rarely stops to breathe. His albums have just kept piling up, 12 of them altogether since 1977, the best of them being the two Bat ones he made with Steinman. As a touring performer â€“ larger-than-life, overwrought, stage-strutting, bellowing, raging, crooning, wearing puffy pirate shirts, ""a mesmerizing, wonderful presence,"" Steinman once said, ""his pupils would roll up in his head, and you'd see the whites of his eyes, and his hands would clutch, it was really powerful, he was extraordinary"" â€“ he's gone on the road for decades at a time. He used to be indefatigable. You want him to play poker on Celebrity Blackjack, to hunt ghosts on Ghost Wars, to warble opposite Luciano Pavarotti, he's always been good to go. ""I've always had a target on my back,"" he likes to say, which maybe explains why, until recently, he's never slowed down. What else can a targeted guy like that do but keep running and, in his case, run fast, because what a big target he is and always has been.""Meat,"" he says, ""came about on the fourth day of me being alive."" This was in Dallas, when his dad, a cop, took one look at his newborn son and said, ""He looks like meat,"" and so Meat he became, nevermore his given name, Marvin. He weighed 185 in the fifth grade, 240 by the seventh. He was bullied about his weight constantly. ""Oh, man, I was tormented,"" he says.Life at home wasn't any better. His father was a violent alcoholic who would disappear for days at a time. He'd return and slap his boy around or throw him through a screen door, then vanish again, whereupon Meat and his mom, a schoolteacher, would hop in the car and go from bar to bar, trying to find him and bring him home again. Bad stuff.Even so, by high school he was beloved by his classmates for his mow-'em-down ways as a football player, and despite his size, he claims he never had a problem with the ladies. ""I had my first three-way in my mother's car in the fifth grade,"" he says, happily. ""OK, it was a make-out session with two girls, but that's still a threesome."" His eyes turn liquid. ""Cindy and Judy,"" he says.His mom, who sang in a gospel quartet, used to say to him, ""Good thing you're not going to be a singer, because you can't carry a tune in a bucket."" That's how Loaf remembers it, anyway. But he claims that all changed in his sophomore year, out on an athletic field, when a 12-pound shot put sailed 62 feet through the air and hit him in the head; after that, just like that, while trying out for choir, he discovered he suddenly had a three-and-a-half-octave vocal range. His mother died of cancer in 1966, when Loaf was 19. Shortly after the funeral, his father, drunk and bereft, kicked open his bedroom door and came at him with a butcher knife, for reasons unknown. ""I rolled off the bed just as he put that knife right in the mattress,"" he says. ""I fought for my life. Apparently I broke three ribs and his nose, and left the house barefoot in a pair of gym shorts and a T-shirt."" He never went home again and, in 1967, moved to L.A., started acting, started singing in bands, was John Belushi's understudy in a Broadway production of the National Lampoon Show, which was where he met Ellen Foley, the actress-singer with the cracked-velvet voice who is the recipient of his love and lust in the 1977 hit ""Paradise."" ""Growing up in a bumfuck Texas town, he might have become a serial killer or the guy who shot up the local 7-Eleven,"" Foley says. ""But the first time I saw him, he walked in with this incredible bravado and confidence, like in his mind he was already fully formed. He had this will that allowed him to do what he had to do to survive and exorcise a lot of his demons, through music. But there's a lot of sadness and anger, which is pretty much at the core of what he does.""He met Steinman while auditioning for a play. The two began working on Bat in 1972, finished a demo (with the help of Todd Rundgren) in 1975, and spent the next two years being rejected by every record label in the land, before someone took a chance and probably regretted it until March 1978, when Loaf appeared on Saturday Night Live and the album finally took off, propelled by a half-sappy, moon-pie Springsteen-on-acid-and-a-sugar-high-rush theatricality that'd never really been seen before and that blew right through the melancholy confines of the then-dominant punk scene.A year later, without telling Loaf, Steinman holed up somewhere in New Jersey with Bruce Springsteen keyboardist Roy Bittan to work on a Bat follow-up. ""And that pissed me off,"" Loaf says. ""I'm going, 'No. That's wrong,' because Jim and I did everything together on Bat Out of Hell, and we need to do everything together. Roy Bittan. When I found out, I thought I was going to kill myself, and I think I had already tried, but I don't remember it. What happened next is, I basically had a nervous breakdown.""""From how I grew up, that's where I learned to be tough and to never stop. I mean, I'm tough as nails. ... Nothing, nothing has ever put me down. ... I never go down.""For the next few years, in fact, Loaf regressed into a pre-shot-put-to-the-noggin state and couldn't sing. He'd open his mouth and, as Steinman once said, ""he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcistâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰like a dragon trying to sing. It was a horrifying sound."" It took daily visits to a shrink for six months for him to get his voice back. After that, he released solo records that went nowhere, got into various big-money lawsuits with Steinman, finally patched things up with him, and together they staged one of the most startling comebacks in rock history with 1993's Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell and the single ""I'd Do Anything for Love.""""From how I grew up,"" Loaf says, ""that's where I learned to be tough and to never stop. I mean, I'm tough as nails. Once I was hit in the head with a pool cue and just turned to the guy and said, 'You just made a big mistake.' Got hit in the head with a whiskey bottle. Had my head slammed into a locker. I've had 18 concussions. And nothing, nothing has ever put me down. Yeah, man,"" he says, ""I never go down.""The day is getting short, the light turning brittle, and Loaf has been sitting for far too long. ""I've got to get up and walk,"" he says, rising to his feet. ""My back is driving me crazy. But then I'm probably a little crazy anyway, because of all the concussions."" He gets behind the walker and shuffles forth, down a hallway past wife Deborah in the kitchen.Along the way, he enumerates who he's voted for: McGovern, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Obama the first term but not the second. As for Trump, whom he met several times while filming Celebrity Apprentice, he's been reluctant to talk about him. It's the same today. ""I'm not gonna tell ya,"" he says, mulishly, when asked who he voted for in 2016.But if you shout at him loud enough, maybe moan something like, ""Oh, come on!"" he'll once again demur, only to shrug, lower his voice and say, ""I voted for Trump."" But that's all he says. He doesn't say why or how he feels about him now, which just about says it all regardless.He presses forward, going deeper into the past. He's got all this history, all these stories. There's the time he gave Springsteen advice about how to make a music video. ""I said, 'You just can't let your eyes go dead. When you're lip-syncing, just repeat the words with your eyes and they won't go dead.' That's working-the-camera 101. I told Billy Joel the same thing."" There's the time he sat next to John Lennon in a diner and the only thing he could think to say was, ""Pass the Sweet'N Low."" Then he returns to Springsteen. ""You know, your magazine started this thing where we stole everything for Bat Out of Hell from Springsteen and it was nothing but a rehash of Born to Run."" He shakes his head. ""I'm saying to myself, 'Where does Springsteen have a 'Two Out of Three'? Where does he have a 'Paradise'?' The only thing that is close to Springsteen is the first verse from 'Bat,' and Steinman wrote that verse before Born to Run was released.""""Look, I am a sex god.&nbsp;But I am not a rock star. ...&nbsp;I don't pretend to be [a legend]. I want to be just a normal human being.""He's back at his chair again, looking down, figuring the angles to get himself seated. He doesn't know whether he'll ever make another record, doesn't know if he'll ever tour again. It's all dependent on the vagaries of his health. And Steinman, who rarely speaks to the press, seems to be in the same boat. ""He doesn't want me talking about his health, but I'm worried about him,"" says Loaf. He adds, ""You know, my dream was never to be a rock &amp; roll star. I wanted to play professional football. I've never wanted to be a rock &amp; roll star.""""Oh, tell the truth,"" says Deborah from the kitchen. ""You sex god, you.""Loaf smiles. ""Look. I am a sex god. But I am not a rock star. When people call me a legend, I say, 'Don't call me that, I'm not a legend.' I don't pretend to be one. I want to be just a normal human being.""But, of course, he's never been normal.

27,David Browne,2017-11-08T18:27:46.917Z,Jerry Garcia Band's Ron Tutt Looks Back on 'Cats Under the Stars' Sessions,"jerry garcia, jerry garcia band, jerry garcia cats under the stars, ron tutt, ron tutt jerry garcia, cats under the stars, ron tutt elvis, ron tutt neil diamond, ron tutt neil diamond",Rolling Stone,"Last week, Ron Tutt, best known as Elvis Presley's drummer from 1969 to 1977, did something he hadn't done in nearly 40 years: He listened to the Jerry Garcia Band's Cats Under the Stars. Appreciated as Garcia's most fully realized and produced solo album outside the Grateful Dead, Cats Under the Stars features at least one Garciaâ€“Robert Hunter gem (""Rubin and Cherise""), unusually layered production, and the drumming of Tutt, who became a recurring member of Garcia's band in 1975. With the 40th anniversary of Cats Under the Stars approaching in April â€“ a special vinyl edition of the album has just been released to commemorate it â€“ Tutt, who has largely remained silent about his days with Garcia, spoke with RS about that unusual moment in his and Garcia's career. (Tutt left the Garcia band in 1978 and in 1981 joined Neil Diamond's band, where he's been holding down the beat ever since.)So many people who have worked on Cats Under the Stars have spoken about Garcia, but you never have. Any reason why?Well, as far as music fans or drum fans or whatever, they all have a  tendency to go towards Elvis. And like it or not, that's what I've been saddled with, you know.So it's not because you have particularly bad memories.Well, I just remember the good things, that's for sure. You got to. I just remember laughing a lot and having a good time musically, so I have nothing but good memories.You first worked with Garcia on his 1974 solo album Compliments of Garcia. How did that come about?John Kahn [Garcia's bassist and co-producer] had evidently wanted to get together with me in the studio 'cause they were going to do a studio album. So we got together in L.A. and did the album and we had so much fun hanging out and playing. It was relaxed and we just hit it off so well that they said, ""Hey, would you be interested in coming up and doing some gigs that we do? We play at this club up in Berkeley called the Keystone."" So one thing led to another and we started doing a few gigs, which took on several different postures â€“ the Jerry Garcia Band, Legion of Mary and so on. Elvis' schedule was basically twice a year in Vegas. And in between those two gigs we were open to whatever we wanted to do, so it gave me opportunities to pick and choose a little bit.Since you hadn't met Garcia before, what were your earliest impressions?He was very loose and laid back. He was really open to everybody's ideas and just wanted to have a good time and hang out and play some good music. He was a pretty simple guy when it came to that.What surprised you about him?Well, his devotion to his instrument. He had his guitar with him at all times. When we would go to the gig, he'd go into the dressing room and sit there and play the whole time instead of resting and hanging out. And when it came to composing his solos, he was very thoughtful. If he was playing a tender ballad, he could build it soft and then get it to where it was roaring towards the end. A lot of people don't give him the credit he deserves when it comes to that.Talk about those Keystone gigs. I'd imagine that experience was very different from an Elvis gig.Extremely different from everything you can think of, starting with the presentation. Jerry was a real purist, shall I say. One time he said to me, ""I don't believe in a lot of talk on a microphone â€“ look what's been done to people over the years, you know. Hitler made pretty bad use of microphone with people and I don't believe in jiving people."" He would come out at the beginning of the night and say ""Hi ya,"" and at end of the night ""See ya."" I'd always laugh because one night I'd be in Vegas playing with rhinestone two-piece outfits and the next night I'd be out with Garcia with the tie-dye and a pair of jeans. Socially speaking it was really different.For Garcia's 1976 album Reflections, you cut a version of ""Mystery Train."" Did Jerry ever grill you about Elvis?Nah. I think he really appreciated what he did but he was never a quote-unquote fan or never wanted to know inside information.In terms of what they expected from you as a drummer, how were Garcia and Elvis different?Elvis' music was a lot more in your face; you could never play enough. But with Jerry we never talked about it, but I just knew my role with that band, no matter what configuration it was, was to help keep it together. We weren't there to do flashy solos. I don't know that I ever even did a solo. That wasn't our purpose. I almost liken it to a jazz gig in the sense that the songs had as we call 'em a head, a front, and then everybody played as much as they wanted to play and then did the out and that was it. There wasn't much rehearsal.Cats Under the Stars seemed as if it was going to be a fresh start for Garcia and the band â€“ an album of all original material, well produced, and with a new solo record deal. Was that your impression?They had contacted to me to do the thing for the summer and we had signed the contract for the group with Arista and Clive Davis. They asked me if I would consider staying in the area for a while. So I said sure, so we leased a house in Mill Valley and basically moved in for the summer. It was a neat time. We used the Dead's rehearsal hall [Front Street]. It never really was a serious studio, but it had a pretty decent sound.Jerry would often call Cats Under the Stars his best album. Did he express his goals for the record to you?He was ready for another chapter in his music. He was ready to move into â€“ I don't know how to say it, it's not necessarily pop music, but he was ready to move on to find something that was more reflective of what he was writing and thinking about at that time, instead of doing cover songs like Smokey Robinson songs. All those songs are great, and they're fun to play, but as far as the commercial aspect of it, he wasn't above making money.	I think he enjoyed the freedom we gave him to be able to do just different things he would always wanted to try. So in that sense it was experimental and he got a chance to just try different musical styles and genres. I think he needed that kind of a challenge. It opened him to a whole different approach. It was different than, say, Legion of Mary, where it was kind of a jam band [laughs].What did you make of the album after hearing it again after so long?  I'd forgotten how much production had gone into it, but not in a bad way.  Strangely enough, I thought there were certain tracks there that were real Beatle-esque, real McCartney-and-Lennonâ€“sounding. I thought some of it was very inventive. Some of it was straight-ahead like ""Rhapsody in Red."" And ""Love in the Afternoon"" was a really cool thing, kind of pseudo-reggae. That's just something we all played and felt we thought would work. Jerry was never any kind of guy to ever say, ""Hey, try this and we need so-and-so people for this."" He was very loyal to his band in that way. Did you ever see members of the Dead hanging around?No, no. Every once in a while, one of 'em would show up if they had to go to the office or something. But no, we didn't do any hanging out.Elvis died that summer [1977]. Were you making that record with Jerry when that happened?Yeah, we had quit for that weekend and I'd driven back home to L.A. And it was that weekend we heard the news.You left the Garcia Band soon after. What happened?We were at a point [in the Garcia Band] where the band had gone as far as it was going to go musically and personally with the personnel that was there. It was a wait-and-see-what's-going-to-happen kind of a thing. After Elvis died, I had to make a decision so I immediately jumped back into the studios in L.A.Did the drug scene around Garcia have anything to do with your decision?Well, I think it was a sign of the times. Everybody was, you know, sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll, as they say. But it was more drugs and rock &amp; roll than anything else [laughs]! It had its pull, there's no doubt about it. But I don't know it was something that everyone was doing and experimenting with.You hooked up again with Garcia for some shows in 1981 but then joined Neil Diamond â€“ another big change, I would think.Yeah, yeah. Definitely a change. Neil was keeping me busy and [Garcia] came to an end, so to speak. It's a shame because I learned a lot from Jerry. He felt lighting and sound and the atmosphere in which the sound was created were important. We looked for special places to play. These colosseums and arenas are not built for acoustics. They're built to bring lots of people together so promotion can make a lot of money. Which is OK; it's our way of life. But that wasn't the driving factor with Jerry. I guess he saw enough of that with the Dead that he felt when it came to doing gigs with his band, he'd find special venues. He believed in music and no hype.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,Jann Wenner,2017-12-27T14:00:00.000Z,Bono: The Rolling Stone Interview,"u2, bono, u2 songs, u2 albums, bono death, u2 members, bono age, adam clayton, the edge, u2 news",Rolling Stone,"In 1985, shortly after U2 broke through in America, Rolling Stone named them the ""band of the Eighties."" Over the course of 30 years and 16 cover stories, the magazine has forged a deep relationship with U2. The band's new album, Songs of Experience, topped the charts in early December, meaning U2 now have a Number One album in each decade from the Eighties on.I first interviewed Bono in 2005, when we talked for 10 hours over a long weekend in CancÃºn, Mexico, starting an intimate dialogue about rock &amp; roll, social justice, faith and the purpose of art. This interview picks up where that one left off, although this time the stakes are much higher. The election of Donald Trump and a rising wave of fascism in Europe had rocked Bono, as had a near-death experience he suffered while making Songs of Experience. While he still finds it difficult to talk about his ""extinction event,"" as he calls it, Bono opened up about its profound effect on both his life and on the new album.We conducted the interview over two sessions at the kitchen table of my New York apartment, around the corner from Bono's own place in the city. In person, Bono is warm, engaging and thoughtful, even while discussing difficult subjects. What shines through as much as anything is his ambition, which burns as brightly as ever. U2 remain hungry â€“ for new approaches to songwriting, for finding their place in the age of streaming, for a new tour planned for the spring. Bono continues to pour his energy into global causes, meeting with world leaders and working on behalf of his ONE Campaign, which fights extreme poverty. He is the rarest of rock stars â€“ an artist and an activist in the same measure. As always, he remains an optimist â€“ and one of rock's greatest talkers, full of wit and candor and poetry.You just finished the Joshua Tree tour. Nostalgia is something U2 like to avoid, so what was it like going out and playing an old album every night?The stance that we took was [to act] as if we had just put out The Joshua Tree the week before. So there were no old Super 8 films or anything to give the sense of that time. We felt that its strength was that it had meaning, maybe even more meaning now than it did then. That was the conceit, and it got better and better. We ended with four nights in Sao Paulo, in front of, I think, nearly 300,000 people, and it was quite the crescendo.But if I am honest â€“ and I probably should be in this interview â€“ I haven't quite recovered from it. I gave myself to the singing in new ways, but there wasn't a lot of going out and discovering the places we were playing, the cities that we were playing, which I really love to do. Stepping inside the songs was more of an ordeal than I thought it would be. They are very demanding in terms of their emotional â€“ what word am I looking forâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰forthrightness. And then we were preparing for Songs of Experience. All that promotion takes a lot more work than I remember, but if you believe in the songs, you have to defend and present them.Songs of Experience&nbsp;just debuted at Number One on the albums chart, which means you've had a chart-topping album in every decade from the Eighties on. Why do you still push so hard for hits?I mean, it's not for everybody â€“ and it can't be for us all the time. But it just felt right. These last two albums mix up the personal and the political so that you don't know which one you're talking to. That's a kind of magic trick, and realizing that of course all the problems that we find in the exterior world are just manifestations of what we, you know, what we hold inside of us, in our interior worlds. The biggest fucker, the biggest asshole, the biggest, the most sexist we can be, the most selfish, mean, cunning, all those characters you are going to see them in the mirror. And that is where the job of transformation has to start first. Is that not what experience tells us?How did you envision Songs of Experience in relation to Songs of Innocence, its companion album from 2014?I had this idea of your younger self talking to your older self for quite a while. It is an interesting dramatic device. [Several years ago] I was at an exhibition of Anton Corbijn's photographs in Amsterdam, and someone asked me what would I say to this photo; I think it was a shot of me at age 22. I thought about it, and then I said, ""Stop second-guessing yourself. You're right.""And then the person asked what the younger me would say to the older me. I got a bit nervous. I wasn't sure. I took that hesitation as a clue that maybe I wasn't comfortable with where I am now. I was starting to realize that I had lost some of that fierceness. Some of that clarity, that black-and-white point of view.But now it seems like you're in another place entirely. It seems like you have more clarity, that you learned more.I'm less unsure about taking political risks or social risks. When I became an activist, people were like, ""Really?"" But they eventually accepted that. Then I started to be interested in commerce and the machinery of what got people out of poverty and into prosperity. And then a few people said, ""You can't really go there, can you?""I said, ""But if you are an artist, you must go there."" You and I have had the conversation over the years: What can the artist do? What is the artist not allowed to do, and are there boundaries? Now, I would say to my younger self: ""Experiment more and don't let people box you in. There is nothing you can't put on your canvas if it is part of your life."" We have this idea in the culture that came out of the Sixties and Seventies, that artists were somehow above the fray, or should be above the fray.That they have an excuse not to participate.I had an excuse not to participate. But I knew that some people who have regular jobs are just as valuable as the artists, maybe more valuable. And there are more assholes per square inch amongst us artists. I remember meeting BjÃ¶rk, and she said that in Iceland, making a chair is a big deal. Like, a song is not more important than a chair. And I went, ""Well, depending on the chair, Irish people know that to be true."" So if that is true, then stop this nonsense that an artist is an elevated person.One thing this record seems to be about is survival. The survival of the world, and of our political system. But let's talk about your own survival. In the middle of recording, you had a near-death experience. Tell me what happened.Well, I mean, I don't want to.I understand. I had my own experience recently. People want to ask about my health, and I'm hesitant to talk about it. Why do I feel that way? Am I ashamed? Is it weakness I am trying to cover up?It's just a thing thatâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰people have these extinction events in their lives; it could be psychological or it could be physical. And, yes, it was physical for me, but I think I have spared myself all that soap opera. Especially with this kind of celebrity obsession with the minutiae of peoples' lives â€“ I have got out of that. I want to speak about the issue in a way that lets people fill in the blanks of what they have been through, you know?It's one thing if you were talking about it in a place of record like Rolling Stone, but by the time it gets to your local tabloid it is just awful. It becomes the question that everyone is asking.But let's talk about it in an elliptical sense. I mean, it's central to the album.Yeah. This political apocalypse was going on in Europe and in America, and it found a perfect rhyme with what was going on in my own life. And I have had a hail of blows over the years. You get warning signs, and then you realize that you are not a tank, as [his wife] Ali says. Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.In 2000, you had a throat-cancer scare, right?No, it was a check for it. One of the specialists wanted to biopsy, which would have risked my vocal cords â€“ and it turned out OK.A few years ago, I visited you in the hospital with your arm in some kind of George Washington Bridge structure.After my bike accident, pretending it was a car crash.It looked bad, and then the latest thing. That is a lot of brushes with death.There is comic tragedy with a bike accident in Central Park â€“ it is not exactly James Dean. But the thing that shook me was that I didn't remember it. That was the amnesia; I have no idea how it happened. That left me a little uneasy, but the other stuff has just finally nailed me. It was like, ""Can you take a hint?""You are making the album and then all of a sudden you had to deal with your health issue. How did it affect the album and your vision of it?Well, strangely enough, mortality was going to be a subject anyway just because it is a subject not often covered. And you can't write Songs of Experience without writing about that. And I've had a couple of these shocks to the system, let's call them, in my life. Like my bike accident or my back injury. So it was always going to be the subject. I just didn't want to be such an expert in it.I met this poet named Brendan Kennelly. I have known him for years; he is an unbelievable poet. And he said, ""Bono, if you want to get to the place where the writing lives, imagine you're dead."" There is no ego, there is no vanity, no worrying about who you will offend. That is great advice. I just didn't want to have to find out outside of a mental excursion. I didn't want to find out the hard way.So how did the idea of mortality come into play?Gavin Friday, one of my friends from Cedarwood Road [in Dublin], has written one of my favorite songs. It is called ""The Last Song I'll Ever Sing,"" about this character in Dublin, back when we were growing up, called the Diceman, who died at 42, five years after he was diagnosed with HIV. I realized only recently that ""Love Is All We Have Left"" is my attempt to write that song.Can you be more precise? Like, what songs do you think came directly out of your near-death moment?It's not so much songs asâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.The mood of it.I thinkâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰I mean, how about this: ""The Showman"" â€“ that is a light song, a fun song, and it became a really important song. Not surrendering to melancholy is the most important thing if you are going to fight your way out of whatever corner you are in. Self-pity? The Irish, we are fucking world-beaters on that level; it's our least-interesting national characteristic. And I never wanted to surrender to that, so punk rock, the tempo of some songs, suddenly became really important.But the second verse is the key, and it has the best line in the album, which is this: ""It is what it is, it is not what it seems/This screwed up stuff is the stuff of dreams/I got just enough low self-esteem to get me to where I want to go."" I wish I could say it was mine, but it was Jimmy Iovine who said it. A friend of mine was slagging him off, and I said, ""Oh, a little insecure there, Jimmy?"" And Jimmy turned around and said, ""I got just enough low self-esteem to get me where I want to go."" That sounds like a realistic appraisal of you and your bullshit.Performers are very insecure people. Gavin Friday, his line to me years and years ago was ""Insecurity is your best security for a performer."" A performer needs to know what is going on in the room and feel the room, and you don't feel the room if you are normal, if you're whole. If you have any great sense of self, you wouldn't be that vulnerable to either the opinions of others or the love and the applause and the approval of others.The whole event enriched the album, though â€“ talk about an experience.But isn't that great? I thought Experience would be more contemplative, and it has got that side, but the heart of the album is the spunk and the punk and the drive of it. There is a sort of youthfulness about it. A lot of the tempos are up. And it has some of the funniest lines, I think. ""Dinosaur wonders why he still walks the Earth."" I mean, I started that line about myself.Being a dinosaur?Yeah, of course, but then I started to think about it in terms of what is going on around the world. And I thought, ""Gosh, democracy, the thing that I have grown up with all my lifeâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰that's what's really facing an extinction event.""In an interview that you and I did in 2005, you said this: ""Our definition of art is breaking open the breastbone, for sure. Just open-heart surgery. I wish there were an easier way, but people want blood, and I am one of them.""Life and death and artâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰all of them bloody businesses.How did your faith get you through all of this?The person who wrote best about love in the Christian era was Paul of Tarsus, who became Saint Paul. He was a tough fucker. He is a superintellectual guy, but he is fierce and he has, of course, the Damascene experience. He goes off and lives as a tentmaker. He starts to preach, and he writes this ode to love, which everybody knows from his letter to the Corinthians: ""Love is patient, love is kind.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰Love bears all things, love believes all things"" â€“ you hear it at a lot of weddings. How do you write these things when you are at your lowest ebb? 'Cause I didn't. I didn't. I didn't deepen myself. I am looking to somebody like Paul, who was in prison and writing these love letters and thinking, ""How does that happen? It is amazing.""Now, it doesn't cure him of all, of what he thinks of women or gay people or whatever else, but within his context he has an amazingly transcendent view of love. And I do believe that the darkness is where we learn to see. That is when we see ourselves clearer â€“ when there is no light.You asked me about my faith. I had a sense of suffocation. I am a singer, and everything I do comes from air. Stamina, it comes from air. And in this process, I felt I was suffocating. That was the most frightening thing that could happen to me because I am in pain. Ask Ali. She said I wouldn't notice if I had a knife sticking out of my back. I would be like, ""Huh, what is that?"" But this time last year, I felt very alone and very frightened and not able to speak and not able to even explain my fear because I was kind ofâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.When you felt like you were suffocating?Yeah. But, you know, people have had so much worse to deal with, so that is another reason not to talk about it. You demean all the people who, you know, never made it through that or couldn't get health care!Do you feel like you lucked out?Lucked out? I am the fucking luckiest man on Earth. I didn't think that I had a fear of a fast exit. I thought it would be inconvenient 'cause I have a few albums to make and kids to see grow up and this beautiful woman and my friends and all of that. But I was not that guy. And then suddenly you are that guy. And you think, ""I don't want to leave here. There's so much more to do."" And I'm blessed. Grace and some really clever people got me through, and my faith is strong.I read the Psalms of David all the time. They are amazing. He is the first bluesman, shouting at God, ""Why did this happen to me?"" But there's honesty in that too.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰And, of course, he looked like Elvis. If you look at Michelangelo's sculpture, don't you think David looks like Elvis?He's a great beauty.It is also annoying that he is the most famous Jew in the world and they gave him an uncircumcisedâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰that's just crazy. But, anyway, he is a very attractive character. Dances naked in front of the troops. His wife is pissed off with him for doing so. You sense you might like him, but he does some terrible things as he wanders through four phases â€“ servant, poet, warrior, king. Terrible things. He is quite a modern figure in terms of his contradictions.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰Is this boring?But if you go back to his early days, David is anointed by Samuel, the prophet Samuel, and, above all, his older brothers, a sheepherder presumably smelling of sheep shite, he is told, ""Yeah, you are going to be the king of Israel."" And everyone is laughing, like, ""You got to be kidding â€“ this kid?"" But only a few years later, Saul, the king, is reported as having a demon and the only thing that will quiet the demon is music.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰Makes sense to me. David can play the harp. As he is walking up to the palace, he must be thinking, ""This is it! This is how it is going to happen."" Even better, when he meets the king and gets to be friends with the king's son Jonathan. It's like, ""Whoa, this is definitely going to happen! The old prophet Samuel was right."" And then what happens? In a moment of demonic rage, Saul turns against him, tries to kill him with a spear, and he is, in fact, exiled. He is chased, and he hides out in a cave. And in the darkness of that cave, in the silence and the fear and probably the stink, he writes the first psalm.And I wish that weren't true. I wish I didn't know enough about art to know that that is true. That sometimes you just have to be in that cave of despair. And if you're still awakeâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰there is this very funny bit that comes next. So David, our hero, is hiding out in the cave, and Saul's army comes looking for him. Indeed, King Saul comes into the cave where David is hiding toâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰ahâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰use the facilities. I am not making this up â€“ this is in the Holy Scriptures. David is sitting there, hiding. He could just kill the king, but he goes, ""No, he is the anointed. I cannot touch him."" He just clips off a piece of Saul's robe, and then Saul gets on his horse as they go off. They're down in the valley, and then David comes out and he goes, ""Your king-ness, your Saul-ness, I was that close.""It is a beautiful story. I have thought about that all my life, because I knew that's where the blues were born.On ""Lights of Home,"" you write, ""I shouldn't be here because I should be dead. I can see the lights in front of me. I believe my best days are ahead, I can see lights in front of me. Oh, Jesus, if I'm still your friend, what the hell, what the hell you got for me?""There is a Bob Dylan reference in that song; I'll just tell you 'cause I know you love Bob. It goes, ""Hey, now, do you know my name? Where I'm going? If I can't get an answer in your eyes, I see it, the lights of home."" At least in my head, the reference is to one of my favorite Dylan songs, ""SeÃ±or SeÃ±or."" In that song, he meets an angel and he, like, goes on this ride with him. I have always imagined it is the angel of death.The full name of the song is ""SeÃ±or (Tales of Yankee Power)."" Does that help explain?No, I think that is Bob putting you off the trail.Your song asks, ""Jesus, what have you got for me?"" Well, what do you think he has got for you?There is an unbelievable release in letting go. I thought I already had, but this was the next installment in trust. You know, people of faith can be very annoying. Like when people on the Grammys thank God for a song and you think, ""God, that is a shite song. Don't give God credit for that one â€“ you should take it yourself!"" I am sure I have done that myself. And someone's like, ""I got this directly from the mouth of God!"" And you're thinking, ""Wow, God has no taste!""He can't write a fucking tune!Like, ""That is a bad rhyme, God!"" So you have got to be very careful of this, but if you're asking me what I learned, I've learned to try and put time aside to meditate on the day ahead. I don't want to get all religious on your ass, so do forgive me, but if you're interested, this is today's meditation. I will share this with you because it is beautiful and because it might make you smile. Here it comes. This is Psalm 18, and it is one of those psalms of David that has been translated into a modern idiom by this man called Eugene Peterson â€“ great writer. It goes: ""God made my life complete when I placed all the pieces before him. When I got my act together, he gave me a fresh start. Now, I'm alert to God's ways. I don't take God for granted. Every day I review the ways he works. I try not to miss a trick. I feel put back together, and I'm watching my step. God rewrote the text of my life when I opened the book of my heart to his eyes."" Isn't that beautiful?That is beautiful. Tell me about the theme of love on this album. You start the record with ""Love Is All We Have Left.""It will take me a while to answer your questions, but I will answer them eventually. I was imagining a science-fiction Frank Sinatra. [Sings torchily] ""Love and love is all we have left."" It's almost comic in one sense, except it rips your heart out. Tragic comedy. I thought it would be interesting to write a song from the point of view of a person who maybe wouldn't sing another song. One of the things I ask myself on this album is, ""If you have one thing to say, what is it? If this is all we are left with, I am content with it â€“ love.""What I wanted to do on this album is to occasionally have a dialectical conversation where younger me assails the older me. And so you have that voice in ""Love Is All We Have Left"": [Sings] ""Now, you're at the other side of the telescope/Seven billion stars in her eyes/So many stars, so many ways of seeing/Hey, this is no time not to be alive."" It is the innocent you speaking to the experienced you and saying it is OK. I have come to some peace with that younger zealot that I used to be. And I think that that younger zealot wouldn't disapprove of where I have ended up. Maybe the process of getting there he might not have liked. You're not just singing love songs; these are deep meditations about the power of love.It is probably our big subject as a band. When we sang ""Pride (In the Name of Love),"" that was an excruciating thing for a young male to sing, if you think about it. But if you are asking what side of love this is, you know, the English language is so rich, but it is limited in this word ""love."" There are many other words.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.What about the song ""Ordinary Love""?That's nonromanticized love. The love that people make, the deals that people make to stay together. What Yeats calls ""cold passion."" I love the idea that great relationships have a lower temperature.Not a transactional love, but a day-to-day willingness to tolerate and accept, which requires more patience and less passion.Yes. Ali and I are probably more in love now than when we got together in the first place. I don't think it is given much credit, but when people work through their problems and stay together â€“ ""Ordinary Love"" is that. I hope it's interesting to write love songs. Not the hundreds of thousands of songs about passion and losing your mind to love. Isn't it interesting to write cold, measured, how-we-got-here songs?""Landlady"" is an extraordinarily pretty love song about you and Ali and thanking her for so much.Getting home â€“ that is the big key for me. I can't believe it because I grew up sleeping on people's couches, sleeping on their floor, running away to the circus and joining a rock &amp; roll band. It has taken me a long time to figure out where home is. I left home probably the week my mother died [when Bono was 14]. I mean, I stayed there on [childhood home] 10 Cedarwood Road for the next few years, but I wasn't really there. On Songs of Innocence, ""This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now"" explains the realization that I had, while sitting there, moved address. I was with the band. The band was where I live. They were another family.It has taken me a long time, but I think I finally came home. But the only way I could say that is with some humor. And so on ""Landlady,"" there is a little faux Bob Dylan line, which is ""I'll never know what starving poets meant 'cause when I was broke it was you that always paid the rent."" I have learned a lot from Bob Dylan over the years, and one thing I've learned is that at your most serious moment you need humor. You need fucking humor. That is why I am so proud of the album. You have all this feisty stuff, but you also have, on ""Blackout,"" ""The dinosaur wonders why it's still on the Earth. A meteor promises it is not going to hurt."" That is funny, but so is ""Landlady,"" and that is why ""Landlady"" works. It hopefully has just enough humor and humility for it not to be fucking excruciating. Let me ask you about ""Summer of Love,"" which is about Syria and the refugees. Where did that song come from, musically?There is a guy working with Ryan Tedder, who wrote a beautiful little guitar part. And this was Edge going through his little excitement, saying, ""Oh, if you want something, you just ask for it. Like hip-hop, sample it. Sample it, or replay it."" It was a great freedom for him. So that was part of the spirit of this record too. It was like, ""Let's look in places you don't normally look."" And so we got this beautiful mood, and we have this beautiful melodic sort of almost ode to the Beach Boys and the Mamas and the Papas, and then found the twist. And the twist is the west coast of Syria. And not the west coast of Ireland or California, as a lot of people have reviewed it as.The charts these days are dominated by younger acts. Most everything on the Top 40 is hip-hop or pop. Rock is no longer at the center of our culture. Where does U2 fit into this new world?The table has been gamed a little bit. Right now, streaming is on the ad-based model. And that is very, very young, and it's very, very pop. It's dominated by frequency of plays, but that is not actually a measure of the weight of an artist. When you move from an ad-based model to a subscription model, a funny thing happens. Then, the artist who will make you sign up is actually more valuable.The one you pay for?The one you pay for. If you are a teenager and you are listening to whatever the pop act is, you're probably listening to them 100 times a day. It's a teenage crush, but in a year's time you won't care about that. But artists that have a connection with you and your life, you pay for the subscription service. In fact, we are going to witness a revolution in the way artists and their fans interact. Chance the Rapper, who has a beautiful soul and a mind to match it, has no record label. He is doing it himself, and he is successful to the point where he can give a million dollars to the Chicago school system.But if your music is on Apple or on Spotify, you can speak straight to people. What you need from record labels is advice and, you know, help with how you manage your band or brand or the artwork and the videos and all of that. This is really a transition period. It has been very unfriendly to a lot of artists. I knew Spotify would come through for people, but a lot of my friends were angry for believing me because they said, ""We are just getting micropayments."" I said things were going to change once this gets to scale, and it is going to take a while. It is going to be unpleasant; not a good time to be Cole Porter right now.Is Spotify starting to pay off?As it gets to scaleâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰if the record labels don't share out what they're receiving from Spotify, artists will bypass the record labels and go straight to Spotify or Apple.And so in the ecology of this, where do you fit?We gave away our last album; or rather, Apple gave it away. And very generously, I believe. But the album before that, No Line on the Horizon, was very adult, not of the demographic that are interested in streaming. So we are just going into this now. We haven't really started yet.So you think that the music you are doing now is more streaming-friendly?Yeah. It's so, so interesting, though. We're back to the Fifties now, where the focus is on songs rather than albums. U2 make albums, so how do we survive? By making the songs better. And having, I hope, the humility to accept that we need to rediscover songwriting, which is one reason Edge and I took on Turn Off the Dark, the Spider-Man musical, to get into musical theater, the Rodgers and Hammerstein aspect of songwriting â€“ a lot of the American Songbook came from musicals. We started to get into what you might call formal songwriting.We asked Paul McCartney, ""Where did you get all those incredible chords in those Beatles songs?"" And he said, ""Well, you know, we were a rock &amp; roll band, but to get good gigs we had to do weddings. Like posh weddings. We had to learn Gershwin, all that stuff."" And I went, ""No, I didn't know."" And Paul says, ""Oh, yeah, we got better-paying gigs."" And I went, ""Ah!"" It was like, ""Note to self and Edge: Let's get into musical theater. Let's think about that.""I would say halfway through Songs of Innocence, we really started thinking differently about songwriting, being more formal about it. And now these new songs have melodies you can hear across the street, around the corner. When they're good, you can hear them through the walls. How do you discover new music?The band is always listening to music, and I have got my kids. Jordan is a music snob, an indie snob. Eve is hip-hop. Elijah is in a band, and he has got very strong feelings about music, but he doesn't make any distinction between, let's say, the Who and the Killers. Or, you know, Nirvana and Royal Blood. It is not generational for him. It is the sound and what he is experiencing. He believes that a rock &amp; roll revolution is around the corner.Do you believe it?I think music has gotten very girly. And there are some good things about that, but hip-hop is the only place for young male anger at the moment â€“ and that's not good. When I was 16, I had a lot of anger in me. You need to find a place for it and for guitars, whether it is with a drum machine â€“ I don't care. The moment something becomes preserved, it is fucking over. You might as well put it in formaldehyde. In the end, what is rock &amp; roll? Rage is at the heart of it. Some great rock &amp; roll tends to have that, which is why the Who were such a great band. Or Pearl Jam. Eddie has that rage.And therefore you think that there is space still available.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.It will return.You agree with Eli?His angle was, if the rock &amp; roll revolution isn't happening, we are going to start it.Who do you think U2's audience is? A couple of years ago, you were saying you had to go out and get a younger, newer audience, had to go on a small college tour, had to reinvent.The Apple experiment really helped in that way. Larry [Mullen Jr.] had been very skeptical about that. But, later, he was saying, ""Look, I am up on my [drum] perch [at concerts]. I can see what you can't see, and I can see that the audience is younger."" I asked him how did he know it was related to the Apple experiment. He said, ""Well, because they don't know the words of 'Beautiful Day,' but they do know the words of 'Every Breaking Wave.'â€‰"" And as we go ahead with this album, we are on the radio â€“ it's amazing. I can't think of another artist in their fifties who is on the radio. On mainstream radio. Can you think of any?Nope. Not Bruce, not the Stonesâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.You know that song Bruce wrote, [2007's] ""Girls in Their Summer Clothes""? I heard that song and said, ""This song should be on the radio, why is that not all over the radio?"" I spoke to somebody recently, a Bruce fan, and I said, ""Do you know this song? It is the most insightful song about aging. It is a song of experience, actually."" And they said, ""No, I don't know that."" So these songs, they can slip through the cracks of culture. That's why U2 go after selling our wares the same way we did for our first album.How will you measure success for Songs of Experience?I would like it to have famous songs, so that when we play them in our live show people don't go, ""What is that? Should we go to the bathroom now?""Which songs do you think will become famous?I know that ""You're the Best Thing About Me"" is going to be one of them. I think ""Get Out of Your Own Way"" is going to be one of them. The biggest one of all could be ""Love Is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way,"" but it might be that that is what the radio people are telling us. It could be something like ""The Showman,"" something unexpected or, you know, ""Red Flag Day,"" ""Summer of Love""â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰you know, I don't know.What is the hardest part about being in U2 right now, in 2017?Getting consensus.For example?Some people, in a very sane way, are thinking, ""Why do you want to do this? Why do you want our songs on the radio?"" And I say that, if we believe in our songs, we have to use any medium we can find to reach people. We don't need to do it for money. We don't need to do it for anything. And, of course, our band could tour for the rest of its life just on what we've got. I am asking them to put a lot of energy into recording these new songs and then selling our wares, laying it all on the table, like we did when we were kids. E",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cept we're not kids.So there is a bit of an existential divide as to your ambition, which runs as white-hot as ever.I feel a compulsion to the songs. If you are going to go this far, you have to go all the way. And I don't know if that can last forever. But, wow, do we have the songs now. Coming down here in the car," on one station we heard """"You're the Best Thing About Me."""" On another station", called the Wave," I heard """"Bullet the Blue Sky."""" Quite a rideâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰through about 30 years.How does the rest of the band feel about the new songs?I would say that Edge seems like someone who wants to be in the band more than ever. Certainly more focused on it as a whole. I think the past two albums have reminded him that U2's strengths â€“ above atmospherics and innovation and all that stuff that he loves â€“  are big melodies and clear thoughts. That's where we came in. The verse melody in """"The Best Thing"""" was a return to form from him. I was calling it punk Motown", but I was the punk and he was definitely the Motown.Adam [Clayton] is sampling older eras and dropping them into new eras like a postmodern artist. He's our postmodern postman. Warhol started that sampling thing; he would see it like that. Certain songs have a feel he's copped from someone else. Adam sees us all as artworks. It's like he's walking through the art market and always looking for something interesting. I am not sure Larry knows what to make of the album. He loved the tour, but he and I are probably the hardest on every U2 recording. After we finished Joshua Tree, I remember going to Chris Blackwell's place in Jamaica. The two of us held up the bar each night, commiserating over what a mess we've made of it. He has that sort of Irish [thing of being] down on all things new. I have had that myself at times, but not with this album. But, you know, we are just like that. It is hard to explain.You once said that you were in the business of applying for the job of best band in the world. Are you still in that business?I mean, look, the singer is a crowd-stirrer and a carny barker. We have to get attention for our band, and the firework I will throw into the towns is something outrageous like," """"We are reapplying to be the best band in the world."""" It is just to get people annoyed or talking about it.But also to get yourself stirred up a little.That is true. We just lived with this idea", even in the first 10 years of the band's life," """"What if we didn't screw it up like everyone does? Wouldn't it be amazing if we stuck together for 30 years?"""" I mean", that was crazy. We are at 40 years now, and I think the only way we can conceive of that is to imagine what if the Clash were around? We would have been very interested to see what work they would have done. And, you know, the fact that the Rolling Stones are around is a kind of a miracle and some grace.You're writing about humility on the album. How do you stay humble in your position, especially in an age of over-the-top self-promotion?There's a difference between humility and insecurity. I have the insecurity of the performer, as I said earlier. As a performer, you can feel the room. Even if it's some sort of get-together, a dinner party or an opening, I can feel the room â€“ that is insecurity. Humility is different. Humility is a genuine sense of your place in the universe and understanding that it is OK to play a quiet, supportive role in the lives of others.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰I'm not there yet. Greatness as a person comes from not pursuing it. Pretty dull if you're a performer â€“ the fireworks display is why people are at the show.I used to think that my insecurity was humility because I don't throw my weight around, because I try to treat whomever I meet with respect. But I am not sure if it actually was humility. I think that might have been just good manners.I still have that thing," that """"hellhound on my trail", whatever that Robert Johnson image is. When I am onstage, I still meet that other self, that sort of shadow self. I still have some work to do on myself to get to a place that you might recognize as humility.But it is a struggle you constantly undertake.I think so. I hope you haven't seen me behave in a very arrogant way.Nothing I can recall [accidentally spills coffee].And I have tried not to be, I have tried not to pour coffee all over people.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.What do you make of the refugee crisis that's going on in Europe?Can I step back and try to give a more macro picture before we get into that? In the Western world, in our lifetime, there has never been a moment, until very recently, when fairness and equality was not improving. There were setbacks," but it was as if the  world was on a trajectory toward fairness and justice and equality for all.There is the famous Martin Luther King quote.""""The arc of the moral universe is long"," but it bends toward justice."""" You and I grew up in a world where things were getting better", despite all the setbacks. This was not in the wider world, not in the whole world, but in the world that we grew up in. And the reason for that was largely because after the Second World War, it became very clear for the first time that in the history of the human race we had the ability to extinguish all life.That was a shock to the system that we haven't  properly calibrated. It changed the way Giacometti made art. It changed the way Picasso painted human figures; everything changed both consciously and unconsciously. Rock &amp; roll erupted. All that love and peace stuff came from people born out of the rubble of the Second World War.When the [2016] election happened and people intuited that something awful and something unprecedented was happening, there was a sense of grief. We had Brexit, so people in Europe are feeling this as well. And I thought," """"This is melodrama."""" Why are people", rational people I know, feeling like they are grieving like someone just died? It is an election, and it will correct itself, whatever. But then I realized that something had died. People's innocence had died. And a generation that had grown up thinking that the human spirit had a natural evolution toward fairness and justice was learning this might not be the case. My attitude was," """"OK"," good. Now it is time we wake up and realize we can't take any of this for granted."""" Big primates have been around a lot longer than democracy", and this dude who shall not be named â€“ he is just a new manifestation of that big primate. We got shook. Even in Europe, people have forgotten what fascism did to them. Whether it was fascism described as Stalin or Mao in the state communism," whatever you want to call it. It is forgotten.We are actually going back to the way we used to be. The new normal is the old normal. That is terrifying. The demonizing of """"the other"""" has returned.But to get back to your question. In Europe", people are afraid for their lives and their lifestyles and their livelihoods and their cultural homogeneity, and have started to put up walls around their definition of Europe. It's becoming fortress Europe, and there's an up-drawbridge mentality probably stoked by outside forces. The shame of it is, at the start of the refugee crisis, you had those incredible photographs of families arriving from Syria on trains in Germany, in Munich, and the wonderful reception they received. People bringing shoes and clothes for the kids â€“ spontaneously, not organized. Just the genuine goodness of the German people. And [Angela] Merkel all of a sudden becomes not only the head of Europe, but the heart of Europe. And what happens?Those to the right of her start to crowd in, and people start to carp. And there was a moment in France where if Le Pen had won the election, not Macron, the unification of Europe would have been under threat. Think about that. One of the great positives that came out of the negativity of the Second World War could have been lost.What happened here in the United States is that Le Pen won.That's right.There is this long history where we have seen the country split apart over great moral issues, and survived it, more or less. What might happen here? Are you talking about democracy being a dinosaur?As I said, big primates have always ruled the environments," and democracy is not the natural habitat of homo sapiens.Democracy is a remarkable conceit that depends on an effective news media. So """"fake news"""" is not a fake threat. You have a post-truth president leading a post-trust country. The chilling bit is not that the big primate is quite smart", which he clearly is, but what if he was very smart and less easy to read. What also should be easy to read are the lessons the left and right need to learn from how this absurdity came about. It shouldn't take a reality-TV star to read the boos and hisses of discontent people ready to roll the dice on business not as usual. We all need to do a better job of understanding where that anger and sense of displacement comes from. As an activist, you have a history of working with politicians. How do you work with anyone in Washington, D.C., right now?I realized I couldn't work with this president whether he wanted to or not, because you can't believe what he says. So I took a meeting with Mike Pence. He had been a defender of PEPFAR [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]. Thirteen million people owe their lives to PEPFAR, and Pence stood up and fought for it in Congress when I was there. So I went," """"Great", I can work with him, but that was in the early days. Cuts [to -PEPFAR] were promised with the overall slashing of foreign aid. The vice president told us in our meeting that he was supportive of PEPFAR, but I have to say it's Congress that deserves credit for stopping the cuts from going through. That makes you ask harder questions about the administration.You visited George W. Bush in Texas recently. Tell me about that.I think that on his exit from the Oval Office he was a much humbler man. When I visited him at his ranch, I found him living very quietly. He hasn't done a lot of speechifying but does do a lot of painting. I am sure he's pained by seeing casualties of recent wars that returned home, and he paints those very people.Laura and his two daughters are very proud of the work America has done in the fight against HIV/AIDS. We worked closely together on that. Condoleezza Rice and Bush's chief of staff, Josh Bolten, also deserve a lot of credit. It is the largest health intervention in the history of medicine. There's now roughly 20 million lives saved in a war that had previously cost 35 million lives. If you want to think about it this way, as many as half the people who died in the Second World War were lost to a tiny little virus. It still hasn't sunk in. There's a lot of us who worked on this, but I'm not sure we even now fully appreciate the scale of what was accomplished in the face of such horror, but it should remind people of what's possible if we can put aside partisanship.What do you say to people discouraged by this moment? Is there hope after this?There is. There is. I think the moment just has to be reclaimed. This is surely the bleakest era since Nixon. It surely undermines the very idea of America, what is going on now. And Republicans know it, Democrats know it â€“ no one's coming off well here. We know some who should know better have tried to piggyback the man's celebrity to get stuff done. They will live to regret it. Before I went out against him in the primaries, I called a lot of Republican friends that I have and said," """"I can't in all conscience be quiet as this hostile takeover of your party and perhaps the country happens."""" And I made the quote", and I still stand by it," """"America is the greatest idea the world has ever had"," and this is potentially the worst idea that has ever happened to it.""""In """"American Soul"," you said America """"is a dream the whole world owns.""""Yeah", that is on this album. Ireland is a very nice country. France is a great country. Great Britain is a great country, but it is not an idea. America is an idea, and it's a great idea. And the world feels a stake in that idea. We want you, it, to succeed, which is why we become fucking obnoxious and shoot our mouths off about it. The world needs America to succeed, now more than ever.Tell me about the ONE Campaign, which fights against extreme poverty. Where are you now with it, and how involved are you?We have nearly 9 million members now, just over 3 million members in Africa. I am hoping that the voices south of the equator will drown out the voices north of the equator. I hope eventually to be put out of a job. And it is becoming a more and more independent organization. Women are stepping to the forefront. Our lead campaign at the moment is called Poverty Is Sexist. And there is another one called Girls Count. About 130 million girls can't go to school who want to go to school. And I am working more in the background. And that is OK.So I am trying to make my own leadership more strategic, more behind the scenes. If I am called on for meetings, I will go. We campaign for transparency in the mining sector and the extractives industry. I am proud of all that work. It is not much written about, but it's as important as fighting HIV/AIDS. Biggest killer in the developing world is not a disease â€“ it is corruption. How are you fighting corruption?ONE campaigned for a rule demanding every mining company registered on the New York Stock Exchange declares how much it pays for mining contracts. Because if those arrangements are not transparent, then it is easy for local governments to fiddle with those numbers, and they are very big numbers. There is a new African proverb, I kid you not: Pray that we do not discover oil. Because it brings all the wrong people to town. If there is an antidote to corruption, if there is a vaccine, it is transparency. Just bring it out in the open.How involved are you with it? You're trying to withdraw from it?I'm not withdrawing at all. I am still heavily involved, but I think it's healthy that the organization doesn't have to rely on me. We've some brilliant people. Our new boss, Gayle Smith, ran development for President Obama and is a real force â€“ Gayle Force, we call her. You'd think during touring it would get quieter, but actually we're meeting leaders in every single place we're in. When U2 played Paris, I went to see Macron and [his wife] Brigitte.What was he like?Macron was very kind to see me; he had just been elected to one of the most powerful offices in the world. I was really taken by his humility in letting me enter it so jovially. He has a quick and inspiring mind, and a secret weapon of a wife who was superaware of ONE's push on girls education in the developing world.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰Education is not easy, it's expensive. We talked about his commitment to get France to allocating 0.7 percent of GNI [gross national income] to development assistance, ODA.And he agreed to 0.55 percent by 2022, something he had not been public about until that meeting. It was a great meeting. But what was impressive about him was that he wasn't focused on the numbers. He was focused on it being effective. He said," """"You are making us keep our promise. We are happy to keep our promise. You have to make sure that the French people get value from money. Because we want to support the fight against extreme poverty.""""Now", would I have gotten that meeting if the tour wasn't coming to a stadium near you? Maybe, because he is more curious and interested than most, but for other leaders, no. The hoopla and razzmatazz of arriving into town with the circus makes people anxious to have a meeting. In America, we have had as many Republicans as Democrats visit us on this last tour. This is no joke. Senators, congressional people, even though we have a moment in the show where we stick it to the man who shall not be mentioned. You've been associated with Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, whose release you advocated for when she was a political prisoner. Now, she seems to be, at best, standing idly by as her country perpetrates what appears to be an ethnic cleansing. What is your take on what is going on there?That is very hard, and I'm â€“ I feel kind of nauseous about that. I have genuinely felt ill, because I can't quite believe what the evidence all points to. But there is ethnic cleansing. It really is happening, and she has to step down because she knows it's happening. I am sure she has many great reasons in her head why she is not stepping down. Maybe it's that she doesn't want to lose the country back to the military. But she already has, if the pictures are what we go by, anyway. The human rights that are being torched, the lives that are being burned out in Rakhine State are more important than a unity without them.You think she should resign?She should, at the very least, be speaking out more. And if people don't listen, then resign. This is all just really troubling. I am still confounded by it, actually.It is startlingly brutal.Is it that we project onto people who we want them to be? We find somebody we like, and we tell ourselves that a person exists that is better than us. More able than us. A truer moral compass than us. We imbue them with all these qualities. We do that with people. I think I have had it done to me. People have their version of you, they project what they want to see on you. Maybe she was always a politician. She was not a saint. She was not some sort of savior. Maybe we were always wrong, and we just have to accept we were wrong. Or maybe something terrible has happened to her that we just don't know.You have done the Joshua Tree tour, you've gotten the new record out, and now you are getting ready to come back for another tour in the spring.&nbsp;What are your thoughts now that the year is over? Any last words of wisdom?I am holding on to the idea that through wisdom

29,Brittany Spanos,2017-10-31T17:58:00.000Z,Willow Smith Talks Coming of Age on Honest New LP,"willow smith, willow smith the first, willow smith interview, willow smith rolling stone interview, willow smith rolling stone, willow smith new music, willow smith michael cera, willow smith album, willow smith 2017, willow smith guitar",Rolling Stone,"Willow Smith turns 17 today, and to mark the occasion she is releasing her most personal album to date, The 1st. It's a raw, emotive piece of music from the teenager who has proudly and gracefully musically matured in front of fans' eyes and ears since debuting at a precocious 10 years old with the pop-meetsâ€“hip-hop hit ""Whip My Hair."" As she reaches the edge of adulthood, Smith embraces the earthy, emotive sounds of a decade that ended just before she was born: the Nineties. While en route to a cabin in the wilderness for a birthday celebration, Smith spoke to&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;about the hard lessons and sometimes surprising influences that inspired her latest collection.How would you describe the musical journey you took to get to this album?When I was younger, I loved to sing all the time. My parents would always tell me, ""We really should do some piano lessons,"" since I was already doing singing lessons. They would always tell me [to learn an instrument] so through my younger years I rejected that idea because it was so potently put onto me. I rejected it until two years ago when I realized that what I want to do musically and as an artist can't have limits. I need to learn music theory. Even with my voice, I had gotten to such a place of comfort with my voice, but then I realized that if you want to keep evolving for the rest of your life, you have to make yourself uncomfortable.I've been trying to put myself in more uncomfortable positions musically and this is really the first step. Is that the origin of the album name, The 1st?That's definitely a layer, but it's not 100 percent the meaning of the name. It's the first time I've put myself in these musical situations that I've never experienced and also these human social situations I've never experienced. Relating to people, in a way that's what not we're taught. We're taught that love, when you're younger, is caring for somebody and wanting their presence around you. As you start growing up, you're like, ""Dang, that person can possess you."" Me doing this album was me realizing my own craving for other people or certain reactions ... I realized that freedom is love. Real love is giving someone 100 percent freedom. The 1st is me realizing not what love truly is, but getting closer to that [realization].How did you go about learning music theory?I literally knew nothing so I just picked up a guitar and started to move my fingers around to learn different sounds. That was really frustrating, though, because when you want to express yourself but you don't have the skills with the instrument, it's a constant battle. At first it was really rough, but then I started talking to other musicians and finding out what different chords and notes sounded like. I started learning intuitively then putting names to them.It's so funny because I listened to Michael Cera's album [True That], and his guitar playing, voice and lyrics inspired me to start playing. He doesn't put himself out there as a musician, but the fact that his music is what inspired me to pick up a guitar was so random. It seems like with this album, your voice is really starting to&nbsp;complement the instrumentation. Your vocal performance reminds me of Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos ...Thank you! They are literally my icons. Alanis Morissette sings with this abandon that is so inspiring, and I try to implement that in my live performances as well. You can tell when someone's singing from their heart. You just look at them and see that they're feeling it.There's also a lot of theatricality in her performances and in yours, too. Like on ""Human Leech,"" it sounds like you're really channeling a lot of deep passion and anger. How did you access that?You know, what we think is love entails a lot of confusion. You ask yourself, ""Why am I acting this way? I need to sit down and analyze myself."" That song was me looking into myself and realizing my tendencies to latch on to somebody and suck their energy. That anger that you're hearing is me being angry at myself. That's what the song is really about.It's like the whole hypocrisy of relationships. Have you ever had someone do something that you think is negative and you're like, ""Ugh, this person is so sus""? Then you're thinking about it in your head and you're like, ""Wait, I do that too. I need to really start being more aware.""Are you talking about love in purely the romantic sense or about non-romantic love too?This is love in all forms. Mostly self-love because when you love someone else, it's so interesting because you start to see how you treat yourself. When you are really in love with somebody, how you treat them and what you want to do for them is how you should be treating yourself. It shows you how you need to be your own best friend. It's a counter-intuitive process.Did you find that playing music helped you gain more clarity on your journey to self-love?Through the feeling of your fingers burning and just trying to keep your fingers on the strings and spending hours sitting and trying to get one riff or one change of chords, you feel like you've climbed a mountain. You feel like you've accomplished so much once you get it. It's like a sixth sense of competence. And through that sense of competence you get confidence. It's a cycle of tracking the progression of your competence and the growth of confidence. Each time the kinds of experiences are the same but the feelings are different. Like for each song you go through, ""OK, I'm learning this. I'm learning this a bit more. Now, I get this."" You start to become friends with the process.Have you experienced many moments in your life of not feeling free? And when you do, how do you regain your sense of freedom?It's so funny because when we start to feel like we're losing freedom, that's when we become less OK with the consequences of us being 100 percent honest. For me, that's what it's like most of the time. When I start to feel constricted or less free, my comfort with the outcome of my honesty is not there. It's not an external thing. Every time I feel constricted in any way, I'm like ""OK, is there something that I want to do or something that I want to say that I haven't done or said because I'm afraid?"" If that's the case, I try my hardest to do or say what I need to do or say. If I still feel trapped after that, I have to go deeper.Finally, as you look toward your 17th year, what are some resolutions you have?I want to rocket my knowledge and intelligence about specifically the science of music. The art of creating music is one thing, but the science of it is a completely different world that I want to become more comfortable with. I'm such a right-brained person that coming at me with logic rooted in creativity takes time for me to get comfortable with that and understand the logistics of my creativity.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,Dan Epstein,2017-11-18T22:00:00.000Z,"Remembering AC/DC's Malcolm Young, Band's Unassuming Mastermind","acdc, malcolm young, acdc malcolm young, malcolm young death, malcolm young tribute, back in black, malcolm young interview, angus young",Rolling Stone,"""There's very few rock &amp; roll bands,"" Malcolm Young explained to a Dutch TV interviewer around the time of AC/DC's 2000 album Stiff Upper Lip. ""There's rock bands, there's sort of metal bands, there's whatever, but there's no rock &amp; roll bands â€“ there's the Stones and us,"" he chuckled. When asked by the interviewer to explain the difference between rock bands and rock &amp; roll bands, he replied, ""Rock bands don't really swing ... a lot of rock is stiff. They don't understand the feel, the movement, you know, the jungle of it all.""Few rock &amp; rollers have ever understood ""the jungle of it all"" like Malcolm Young, and fewer still have ever been as single-mindedly devoted to its perpetuation. From 1973, when he formed AC/DC with his younger brother Angus, to 2014, when dementia and other health issues forced his premature retirement, Malcolm never once allowed the band to deviate from its swinging, swaggering, riff-driven course. During Malcolm's tenure, AC/DC's recordings featured three different lead vocalists, three different bassists and five different drummers; and yet, the band's musical aesthetic remained so stubbornly consistent as to make the Ramones look like flighty trend-jumpers by comparison. AC/DC never mucked about with drum machines or synthesizers, never worked with ""hit doctors,"" never invited guest stars to appear on their records, and never made musically touristic forays beyond the Chuck Berry riffs and Australian bar circuit that originally spawned them â€“ their idea of musical experimentation was to let Bon Scott take a bagpipes solo on ""It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll),"" or affix a tolling church bell to the start of ""Hell's Bells."" The most ""pop"" song in their catalog is ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" a fist-punching paean to marathon fucking, and the closest they ever came to recording a ballad was ""The Jack,"" a nasty six-minute slow blues about contracting gonorrhea. ""Rock and roll is just rock &amp; roll,"" Brian Johnson sagely opined in ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" â€“ and by the same token, AC/DC has always been just AC/DC, doggedly mining the same vein for good-time gold.But if AC/DC's public image was largely defined by Angus's naughty schoolboy, Bon's lascivious pirate and Brian's lusty bricklayer personas, it was Malcom who truly defined the band's lean 'n' mean sound. In addition to serving as the captain of the good ship AC/DC, he was also its chief architect and mechanic, tinkering with riffs and songs as tirelessly as he tinkered with his 1963 Gretsch Jet Firebird, which underwent countless modifications as he strove to unleash the ultimate guitar tone. ""He's the engine in the Mack truck that is AC/DC,"" Anthrax's Scott Ian told Loudwire in 2014. ""He's the driving force behind that band; has been since Day One. To the casual listener, they probably don't know who Malcolm Young is ... but Malcom's the guy. He's the greatest rhythm guitar player ever.""Indeed, while notable guitarists like Ian, James Hetfield and Dave Mustaine have regularly sung his praises â€“ no less an authority than Eddie Van Halen has called him ""the heart and soul of AC/DC"" â€“ the general public has remained largely oblivious to his importance to the band. (As a budding hard rock fan picking up 1979's Highway to Hell for the first time, it was all about Angus and Bon for me; I wouldn't realize until years later that the tiny guy on the album's cover with the tight T-shirt, center-parted hair and thuggishly menacing gaze was actually the one responsible for so many of the clarion guitar riffs that attracted me to the record in the first place.) Such relative anonymity was perfectly fine with Malcolm, who was usually happy to let Angus, Bon or Brian handle band interviews. In concert, he rarely strayed more than a few feet from his Marshall stack, concentrating on keeping the riff machine stoked while his younger brother's duck-walking, pants-dropping, guitar-shredding antics stole the limelight. But Malcolm was far more than just a riff-meister. ""From the get-go, Mal's always been one to come up with melody ideas,"" Angus explained to me in 2005, when I interviewed him for a Revolver feature about the making of 1980's epochal Back in Black. ""I'm a bit rough and raucous â€“ I go for the rhythmic things â€“ but Malcolm will dial in a melody, and likes to get it so it's all hooking together and feels right."" Malcolm had clearly internalized the lessons he'd learned at the knee of older brother George Young, who'd taken on a similarly low-key role as guitarist, songwriter and producer with legendary 1960s Australian hitmakers the Easybeats, and who â€“ in partnership with Easybeats guitarist Harry Vanda â€“ had already become a successful producer of other acts by the time Malcolm and Angus formed AC/DC. (George, who along with Vanda produced such classic early AC/DC albums as TNT, Powerage and Let There Be Rock, died on October 22nd at the age of 70.) Like George, Malcolm was never content with just a gut-punching riff, a swinging groove and a catchy chorus; everything had to be primed for maximum sonic impact, as well.""Mal always had a better ear for recording and mixing than I did,"" Angus told me. ""He was more involved with that when we were younger, fiddling around with sounds and stuff. He tunes into it more than me; I'm more about just picking up the thing and play it. He helped me a lot with dialing in sounds from my amp; I would be saying, 'I can't get nothin' out of this Marshall,' and he would help me sort it out and get the best out of it.""It was also Malcolm who kept AC/DC firmly focused during the traumatic weeks following Scott's unexpected death-by-misadventure in February 1980. While the band's management and record company pressured them to find a new singer, Malcolm was adamant that he and Angus direct their energies into finishing the songs that would eventually become the Back in Black album. ""There were a lot of suggestions [about auditioning singers],"" Angus told me, ""But Malcolm kept saying to me, 'We'll do it when we feel we've got all our music together. The rest of it can wait!' We didn't want to be rushed into anything.""While Malcolm's death at the too-young age of 64 is certainly a massive blow for AC/DC fans everywhere, it's unlikely that he would want Angus to bring it all to an end on his account. Even in his absence, AC/DC has continued to function like a finely-tuned clockwork mechanism â€“ the band successfully soldiered following his retirement, recording and touring behind 2014's Rock or Bust with nephew Stevie Young taking over for his uncle on rhythm guitar. That the band continues to thrive without Malcolm isn't a reflection on his lack of importance to it, but rather a testament to the enduring brilliance of the material he wrote, and the perfection of the musical machine that he designed to deliver it. So long as there's enough electricity left in the world for some guitarist somewhere to hit a ringing, window-rattling A chord, Malcolm Young's spirit will live on. Rock in Peace, Mal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,Andy Greene,2017-12-13T12:55:30.996Z,Bon Jovi on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: 'It's a Christmas Miracle',"Bon Jovi, Bon Jovi Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Tico Torres, David Bryan, Bon Jovi Hall of Fame interview, bon jovi richie sambora",Rolling Stone,"Almost no band that started after the 1970s has been more successful than Bon Jovi. They have sold a reported 130 million records and packed just about every stadium in the world many times over. Their songs are inescapable on classic-rock radio (not to mention karaoke bars) and their last four new albums hit Number One on the Billboard 200. Despite all that, they only appeared on a single Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ballot before finally getting in this year, nearly a decade after first becoming eligible. Frontman Jon Bon Jovi shared his views on why that happened with Howard Stern last year, but presumably all is forgiven now that they are finally in. We spoke with drummer Tico Torres and keyboardist David Bryan a couple of days after they heard the big news. How did you first hear you were in?Tico Torres: Jon called me. It's something that's iconic in a sense. A lot of my friends are in it. It's pretty prestigious. The fact that it covers all types of music is a beautiful thing. Of course, there's so many other people that have yet to be in there like [John] Coltrane. Elvin Jones was my drum teacher for God's sake.How about you, David?David Bryan: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame carrier pigeon dropped by my house and delivered the note. [Laughs]What were your first reactions?David Bryan: It was great. There's a lot of people that are in it. There are a lot of people that aren't in it and deserve to be in it. There's a lot of people that are going to be in it. It's a nice recognition of 25 years after 1984, which is when our first record came out. We're what I call a current classic. We still have a Number One record and we're still out there touring the entire earth and selling out stadiums everywhere, and yet we're still a classic. It's a great thing.Tico Torres: And we're old!Did the news surprise you at all?Tico Torres: I was elated. It was nice to tell my mom and my son. He was the first one. He's 13. I told him right away. I had to tell my mom. We grew up annoying our parents, making noise and having band practice. For me, it's been going on since '67. If anyone deserves the first mention, it would be my mom. Our parents.David, what does this mean to you on a personal level?David Bryan: When you look at it, its almost a journey of your peers. You're in with people you grew up with. They were my heroes, the reason why I play rock &amp; roll. It's an honor to be amongst them. It's a nice nod from the industry. We've been eligible since 2009, so it's nice to be recognized.Did it ever bother you that it took this long?Tico Torres: There's only so much room. Again, David mentioned this, there's a lot of people that should be in before us that have since passed, like Joe Cocker, guys that made statements in life that we grew up with. It's an ongoing adventure of music. It also brings to light a lot of music of people that gets passed to younger people, people just getting into music. They can actually go backwards and research and learn from it.David Bryan: We were at the inaugural, way before the Hall of Fame was built, we played that concert in Cleveland. We had Eric Burdon with us. There were so many greats that night, from Al Green to Little Richard to Jerry Lee Lewis. It was a pretty special event and it's wild that this many years later we're amongst them and there's a building now. It's all good.They're taking in the two of you, Jon, Richie Sambora and Alec John Such. Do you think those are the right ones? Did they miss anybody?Tico Torres: That pretty much covers the band when we started.David Bryan: That was us guys living the dream, getting on a bus with no guarantees in any way shape or form or anything. It was, ""Let's go out and make this happen."" And we actually did. For me, it's a Christmas miracle.Tico Torres: It's funny. You grow up listening to these great musicians and then you get a certain status in your environment as a musician where you actually get to play together and meet each other and jam. You always think, ""Gee, I was born too late."" But then you get better and better and fall in line and you're almost in the same schoolhouse even though you're younger. You get to hang out and play with your peers. It's going to be you guys, the Moody Blues, the Cars, Dire Straits and Nina Simone. There tends to be an all-star jam at the end of the night. Can you think of any song that would work everyone?David Bryan: That has to be the hardest part of the night because everyone has great songs. You can do a standard blues song or something. I don't know. I guess we'll figure it out when we're in the room.Bands usually get three songs. Can you take a guess at which three songs you'll do?Tico Torres: I guess we'll figure that out. It's kind of new to us. You have to include the songs that got us to this point. It's a hard pick. We'll figure it out.David Bryan: We're trying to wrap our heads around it now and figure it all out.Bands often play with former members at the induction ceremony. Are you down to play with Richie Sambora and Alec John Such that night?Tico Torres: Absolutely.David Bryan: Yeah. Why not?Tico Torres: They are a huge part of us. We'd love it if they played with us.Do you keep in touch with Alec?Tico Torres: Honestly, he's a mystery sometimes. The hard part is finding him.David Bryan: Alec is definitely a moving target.He played with you guys in 2001. The fans are always very curious about him. He's the mystery man of Bon Jovi to so many people.Tico Torres: He's always been the mystery man of Bon Jovi, even then he was like 007.Do you think he'll show up?Tico Torres: I think so.David Bryan: I would hope so. The idea is that it's a celebration of what we were and what we are, so that was definitely what we were and we are what we are now. I think its a celebration of both those things. You'll see the current lineup and then see the original. It should be a fun night.Many people will argue that Hugh McDonald should be inducted since he's been there for so long.Tico Torres: He's a big part of the band. They should acknowledge that.What are the future plans for Bon Jovi?David Bryan: We're going to keep touring. That's what we do. We love to make records and we love to tour. We did a handful of shows this year down in South America and played a bunch of big stadiums and Rock in Rio. Next year, we're putting plans together and we're going to do some shows, do what we do.So few bands are able to play those soccer stadiums you guys headline.&nbsp;Tico Torres: The hardest thing about those soccer stadiums is trying to find room in the soccer schedule since that takes precedent. We're lucky in South America that there wasn't much soccer that time of year. But it's incredible to still fill houses. A lot of it is because we try to stay current. We come up with new material and songs and try to reinvent ourselves. It's a journey of a lifetime. I'm glad we're able to do that as a band and keep creating and expanding our limits.I think a lot of fans in America don't realize that you're just as popular overseas, filling stadiums in Asia, Europe â€“ it's a real global thing.David Bryan: The fans realize the hell out of it. It's been something we always set out to to from the beginning, which was play the world. We'd go out and play 50 countries. We've done 50 concerts 30 times. They're familiar with us and we're familiar with them. It's a big world out there. One of the greatest things about our band is that we bring the American dream to the world. Here's a bunch of kids that were living in nowhere New Jersey and we made it through a lot of practice and a lot of work and a lot of luck. It shows the world, ""If we did it, you can do it."" It's that whole dream of ""you can make it"" that we bring to the world.David, you've won Tony Awards. The band has won Grammy Awards. How does this compare to those honors?David Bryan: Any honor is an honor. You can't really say which one is better than the next, but it's always wonderful when you're honored by your peers for your work. There's the Tonys and the Grammys we won and were nominated for. The Tonys were an amazing evening and this will be another amazing evening. It's wonderful to be recognized by our peers, and the fans. This was one of the biggest fan votes. Almost 2 million fans voted for us, which was huge.I'm sure the night will be very emotional.&nbsp;Tico Torres: For me, I live in the present, in the moment. It's one of those experiences I look forward to without a preconceived notion other than I'm excited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,Mosi Reeves,2017-12-08T16:02:02.461Z,"Rapper Dave East on Prison, Islam, Reviving Nineties-Style Skits","Dave East, Dave East Paranoia: A True Story, the hamilton mixtape, nicki minaj, nineties hip hop, gabrielle union, being mary jane, notorious B.I.G., harlem rap, who is dave east",Rolling Stone,"Dave East may be the least likely member of New York's new rap aristocracy to conquer the charts. The East Harlem native's peers, like Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, French Montana and A$AP Rocky, all crested via genre-blending songs that blur the line between electronic pop and clubby trap anthems and boast hooky, unforgettable choruses. By contrast, Dave East hearkens to the height of Rotten Apple rap, a Nineties aesthetic of grizzled street themes, thug bravado and, as J Cole once put it, ""when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody.""Still, that didn't keep the 29-year-old rapper's debut project for Def Jam Records, Paranoia: A True Story, from landing at Number Nine on the Billboard charts upon its August release. It's his second Top 40 release; last year, his mixtape Kairi Channel, which he named after his newborn daughter, peaked at number 38. Dave East's career has soared despite little attention from urban pop radio. Instead, East has earned cosigns from hip-hop OGs â€“ including Nas, who signed him to Mass Appeal Records. His biggest smash so far may be ""Wrote My Way Out,"" a gritty, piano-inflected track he recorded with Nas, Aloe Blacc and Lin-Manuel Miranda for the chart-topping Hamilton Mixtape. He has also hit the studio with Lil Uzi Vert, Drake, Emeli Sande, and Trey Songz.""You're going to hear a lot more artists that are actually rapping, that's actually focused on their lyrics, from New York City,"" East tells Rolling Stone during a recent phone interview. He's rumored to be dropping a sequel, Paranoia 2, sometime in the next few months.&nbsp;East hasn't been entirely absent from online rap chatter. He polished his acting chops on Gabrielle Union's soapy, smart BET drama Being Mary Jane, and his 1.3 million&nbsp;Instagram followers often speculate on his personal life. Yet, contrary to recent trends, Paranoia eschews melodramatic pop crooning in favor of reflective, nuanced rhymes. And it's stitched together with the kind of old-school, hilariously unfunny skits that were widely used during hip-hop's golden era.""Nobody uses skits at all anymore, so it seems like I use a lot,"" he says, adding that they helped shape&nbsp;Paranoia into a fully-fledged album with a conceptual framework, not just an assemblage of demos and would-be singles. ""That's how I grew up on tapes. Biggie tapes, Biggie albums would have skits. The Lox would have skits. Mase would have skits. All the dudes I grew up on in Nineties rap would have skits on their projects, just to make you feel like you were right there with them.""East launched his rap career after a tumultuous childhood and adolescence as an elite basketball player. While attending high school in Maryland, he excelled in AAU tournaments, where he faced off against future NBA stars like Kevin Durant and Ty Lawson. But after stints at the University of Richmond and Towson University, he ""was running around in the streets,"" and was eventually imprisoned for six months, where he submitted himself to Islam. ""It's a balance. Nobody's perfect,"" he says. ""When I'm out of town, I always try to get some readings or some type of new information to where I'm learning more about Islam, just to become the best Muslim I can become.""Beginning with his debut mixtape, Change of Plans, East has lyrically documented his life. He spends plenty of time on his ascent from thug to a rap star who trades bars with Rick Ross and Jeezy. But he's also introspective, particularly on Paranoia's ""Wanna Be Me,"" where he admits, ""Wish I was closer with my nephew, so much to show my niece/Trying to make way, don't go shopping, this nigga know he cheap/Trying to learn the music industry the way I know the streets.""""Growing up in Harlem, growing up in Queens, living in Baltimore, being locked up, going to college, playing ball, trying to sell weed, then trying to rap. I've just been through a lot in 29 years, so I got a lot to talk about,"" he says. ""I always tell people, I never get writer's block because it's coming straight from my brain, like, real-life experiences. I'm like the news. I'm just reporting it for myself.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,Andy Beta,2018-01-19T15:15:53.873Z,"Underground Rock King Ty Segall on the Weirdness of Semi-Fame, Defining Success","ty segall, ty segall interview, ty segall the opposition, ty segall comedy central, ty segall new album, ty segall freedoms goblin, ty segall steve albini, ty segall fred armisen, jordan klepper",Rolling Stone,"Ty Segall is about to be on TV and he looks a little nervous. Not that the fiery, prolific rocker hasn't already made the rounds on the late-night circuit, but as the first musical guest on Comedy Central's parody news show&nbsp;The Opposition With Jordan Klepper, he'll find himself on the air without a guitar in hand, bantering with the host. A few minutes later, Segall seems a little less tense performing ""My Lady's On Fire"" â€“ a single from his forthcoming album, Freedom's Goblin â€“&nbsp;stripping it back to a plaintive ballad strummed on acoustic six-string.""That was a psychedelic feeling,"" Segall admits in a cab after the taping. ""I definitely feel like I blacked out while doing the comedy bits. And playing solo acoustic on TV is very far out and really scary, but really exciting at the same time.""For the past decade, Segall has been on a rampage through the American underground, recording and touring at a breakneck pace. His way with a guitar evokes a Sixties psych-rock shredder, but his penchant for churning out albums annually brings to mind a hungry Internet startup. By his estimate, he's written close to 300 songs.&nbsp;His records â€“&nbsp;Freedom's Goblin is Segall's 10th as a solo artist â€“ melt together classic rock's chops, punk's DIY ethos and garage rock's crunch into a speedball of sound. He's grown his audience steadily, going from making homemade cassettes to selling 100,000 copies of his records. And he caters to his fervent fan base without much help from social media or streaming services (only late last year did his Drag City albums finally appear on Apple Music). Up until 2013, Segall cranked out releases from his home studio in San Francisco, though he and his wife now call L.A. home.""It felt right having Ty come on as our first musical guest,"" Jordan Klepper told Rolling Stone of the Opposition booking, which was fitting given that the aggressive stomp of the show's theme music comes courtesy of Segall himself. ""You see Ty live and there's no surprise whatsoever that he's successful and people go see him every time he's in town. He's just a performer. He knows exactly what he's doing; he gives his all.""Growing up in Orange County, Segall started out as a drummer before he discovered punk rock and switched to guitar at age 15. He says the first tune he ever wrote was ""some weird surf song,"" before guaranteeing that ""no one will ever hear it."" At the ripe age of 20, Segall released Horn the Unicorn, a batch of crusty lo-fi garage rock, on cassette. A year later, John Dwyer â€“ another hyper-prolific underground auteur â€“ released Ty's self-titled album and Segall hasn't relented since. Every successive full-length has tweaked his original vision in subtle but important ways. ""Each album I do I try to have at least a slight rule, whether it's the band has to get together and record live, or all guitars all fuzz on all the time,"" he said. ""It's varying and slight, but yes, I like having rules.""For Freedom's Goblin, Segall recorded at five separate studios, including the one he built in his own garage. He invited legendary engineer Steve Albini to his home in L.A.'s Eagle Rock neighborhood to oversee sessions there. ""Ty likes to chop wood, as we say,"" Albini told RS. ""He doesn't need candles lit or to wait for the muse to alight. He just spits on his hands and makes the record."" The album's 19 tracks veer from ""Fanny Dog,"" a horn-laced ode to his pooch, to the punk blast of ""Meaning"" (shouted by Ty's wife) and the George Harrisonâ€“esque ""Cry Cry Cry.""In the cab, talk turns from Segall's unflagging love for classic rock to an enthusiasm for classic disco. ""Boney M rules!"" he shouts to no one in particular. You can just make out that bizarre Europop band's baritone croak on a song like the bubbly ""Despoiler of Cadaver."" And then there's the album's first single, a buzzsaw take on Hot Chocolate's 1978 hit, ""Every 1's a Winner,"" featuring Latin percussion from none other than Fred Armisen, who has known both Segall and Albini for years and lives just up the road from Segall. ""To me, Ty's about 'make a great record and tour, make a record and play,'"" Armisen told RS. ""It's an old-school work ethic, but it's also a good-art ethic. ... It keeps things pure.""Ask Segall about his steadily growing success, and his voice turns serious. ""I'm from the fully existentialist perspective that no one is fucking special,"" he says. ""No one deserves anything more than anybody else. Because of that fact, you treat everyone the exact same way as best as you can. Same with musical ideas. My ideas aren't better than anybody else's. If I thought any other way, I'd be a fucking dickhead."" Accordingly, Segall felt that the first time he put out a record, he had achieved a lifelong goal. ""To me success has already happened. I get to make records and live doing that. Success is that,"" he says, adding: ""All this other shit is just the cherry on top.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,Andy Greene,2017-10-30T19:30:00.000Z,Weird Al Yankovic Breaks Down His Upcoming 'Ill-Advised Vanity Tour',"Weird Al Yankovic, Weird Al tour, Weird Al 2018 tour, weird al yankovic tour, weird al vanity tour, weird al ridiculously self indulgent ill advised vanity tour, weird al original songs, weird al deep cuts",Rolling Stone,"Anyone that walked into a ""Weird Al"" Yankovic concert at any point during the past 20 or so years knew exactly what they were going to see. The set list would be packed with hits like ""Smells Like Nirvana"" and ""Amish Paradise."" Funny videos from his throughout his career would run while he changed costumes, dressing up like everything from an obese gang member for ""Fat"" to a rapping geek for ""White and Nerdy."" At the end, he'd walk out for the last encore dressed up like a Jedi Knight and belt out ""Yoda,"" complete with a ritualistic chant of gibberish. Every show on any given tour would be exactly like the one before it and the one after, with moments rehearsed down to the exact second.But when Weird Al hits the road in 2018 for the ""Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour"" none of these things will be true. There will be no costumes, props or even video screens. The set list will change wildly from night to night. Most incredibly, he's going to skip nearly all of his parody songs, centering the show instead around his long catalog of original (though still highly comedic) tunes, many of which have never been played in concert. We phoned up Weird Al at his Los Angeles house to learn more about this bold adventure. How did you get the idea for this tour?It was sort of an epiphany near the very end of the last tour. I think I was in the middle of putting on my ""Fat"" suit for the thousandth time and getting ready to go back onstage. I was thinking, ""Gosh, next time I go on tour I don't know if I want to be doing this. I think I need to take a break from all the theatrics. Wouldn't it be nice to just do a really scaled down, low-key, casual show for the hardcore fans and just go out and be musicians?""I just thought, ""Well, that's pretty unrealistic. I don't know if that would ever be able to happen in reality."" But the more I thought about it, the more I thought, ""Why not?"" I'm at a point in my life and career where I can do whatever I feel like doing, regardless of whether it's commercial, or whether it's something people actually want to go see. I know this tour is going to be held in high regard by the hardcore fans, but more than anything, this is for me and the guys in the band because this is a tour that we're going to really enjoy doing.Did you get a lot of pushback from your manager and agent when you told them you wanted to do this?They were kinda of like, ""OK ... yeah ... sure ... that could work."" Then I got a little pushback and they were like, ""Well, you gotta sprinkle some parodies in the show."" And I was like, ""No, that's not the idea. That's not the point of the show."" So once they found out I was really serious about it, about doing it my way ... I think they were still a little skeptical, but ultimately I think they trust my judgement. They're letting me do what I want to do.Are you worried that no matter what you say and write in advance, a certain percent of the audience will still show up expecting to see a regular show?Yeah. I mean, that's always going to happen. I think I put it out there as much as I possibly could what the show is going to be. I think an extremely low percentage of people will come expecting to hear all the hits. There's never a hundred percent success when you try something new. I'm sure some people will probably walk out in disgust because they didn't hear their favorite hit parody, but I'm doing everything I can to make sure people don't have buyer's remorse.Are you going to do style parodies or only pure originals?Here's a good way to determine what I'm considering an original: If I get sole songwriting credit on the song, that means it's an original. That includes any kind of pastiches or style parodies or anything like that.You say that you mostly won't be playing any parodies. Does that mean you'll be doing some?I don't want to give away any surprises. Near the end of the set, there might be a couple of things that we throw in that aren't originals. We might throw them in as a little surprise treat. In the first 75 minutes, at least, there are going to be nothing but originals, so people need to be emotionally prepared for that.How much do you think it's going to change between from show to show?A lot. In cities where we're doing two nights back to back, it's going to be an almost entirely different show between the two nights. We're got over three hours of material, easily, that we're rehearsing. We're trying to learn 50 or 60 songs, so we have a pretty deep catalog to choose from. Usually I don't encourage tour chasers. I tell them, ""I'm glad you enjoy it, but it's literally the same show every single night."" But on this tour, if you go to any two shows, they will be different. Again, if you go to two shows in the same city, it'll be very different.It truly is the polar opposite of everything you've ever done with a tour.Yeah. This is a very, very different tour than what I've done before. As I said, it's a little out of my wheelhouse because I am a guy who likes to have everything planned. I like structure. I like to be able to fall into rhythms and get my muscle memory happening so that I don't need to think about what's coming next. For this tour, I really have to be more in the moment because the setlist changes literally every single night. I want to talk to the audience and be more casual and friendly, because in my normal show, it's basically song, video, song, video. It's non-stop and there's very little time to take a breath and check in with the audience or tell a story if I feel like it. I'm just going to have to relax because this is a whole different kind of energy than every tour I've done in the past. This is not a high-energy show, this is kind of like a ""hanging out with your friends in a living room"" kind of show.Are you going to be seated?That's the idea. I mean, we'll see how it goes, but right now I'm thinking we'll all be on stools and hanging out.It certainly won't be as physically draining as your other shows.Yeah, this is going to be the ""not work up much of a sweat"" tour. I'm a little bit concerned about my voice, though. I'm used to having several breaks during the evening to rest my voice while I'm doing my costume change. This is going to be 90 solid minutes of singing and talking. That's going to be a little more taxing on my voice, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.How shocked was your band when you told them the plan for the tour?They're such good sports, pretty much literally anything I wanted to do they'd say, ""Yeah, that sounds good to us."" I think they're excited about this. They'll really be able to show off their chops. I think the fans have always known the incredible musicianship in my band, but this tour they'll definitely be featured, and it'll be really nice for them to step out and show that they're world class players.What sort of feedback have you gotten from fans about this?It's been extremely positive. Every now and then I'll see something on social media like, ""Oh, gosh, I was going to take my seven-year-old to the tour, and this isn't the show that I think he'd want to see because there's no costumes and production."" But overwhelmingly, I'm hearing from the hardcore fans that, as I predicted, had been waiting decades for this kind of show, and they're getting the opportunity to hear some deep cuts and some obscure tracks that they probably thought they'd never get to hear live. I don't know how that's going to translate into ticket sales, but the response has been extremely enthusiastic.Are you going to play ""Albuquerque?""I think that's pretty much guaranteed. Again, not every show. I'm trying to mix it up. I actually have a little chart that I made. This is me; this is how methodical I am. Every song that we're rehearsing, I've attached a number value to it. ""We're going to play this song 80 percent of the shows, this song at 40 percent of the shows, this song at 20 percent of the shows."" And then I'll kind of mix it up, change the order every night and just make the shows, from city to city, as different as they can possible be.So no song is too obscure, whether it's ""Airline Amy,"" ""Gotta Boogie"" or ""Cable TV"" ...Anything is fair game. If we don't play an original song, it's either because it's too difficult to pull off live and there are a few I feel like without backing tracks or any kind of trickery, they'd be hard to pull off in an acceptable manner. Others, we've played a lot in the past, so they wouldn't be fresh and novel, or they're just not my favorite. That still leaves quite a few songs that we get to choose from.Can you name one song that's just too complicated to play live?Unfortunately, ""Hardware Store."" That's a big fan favorite and I'm sure everyone would love for me to do that live, but that was hard enough to do in the studio, and it would be near impossible to pull off live.Why did you decide to bring Emo Phillips out as your opening act?Normally, my shows are over two hours long, and because this one is going to be literally us playing on stage without any kind of breaks, I thought 90 minutes would be more of a human length. Also, we didn't want to burst anyone's bladder. So I thought, ""OK, we should have an opening act."" In the past, when we had an opening act, we would rely on local promoters to provide a local stand-up comedian. Sometimes they'd be great, sometimes they'd be not so great, and sometimes they'd be completely inappropriate. I thought I could travel with somebody, and my very first choice was Emo. He's one of my oldest friends, and I also happen to think he's one of the funniest guys in the world. I know that my fans love Emo from his appearance in UHF and also because he's Emo. He's an icon.Do you think the next tour will be back to the old format?It will be ... something, yet again, different. I have an idea for what the next tour is going to be after this. I'm not a liberty to say, but it will be, yet again, something different.Getting back to what you said about the ""Fat"" suit and feeling like it was time for a change, did you just get sick of singing the same hits night after night?I didn't get sick of anything. If the audience is into it, it doesn't get old for me. I still love playing ""Amish Paradise"" because the crowd goes nuts every time I walk out onstage. If I walk onto the stage and people are checking their Twitter feed while we're playing, I think, ""OK, maybe I won't do this song on the next tour.""Are you thinking of selling downloads of the shows since every one will be a unique event?Somebody brought that up to us very recently. I can't really answer that right now. I'd say probably not, but it has not been ruled out, so I guess we'll have to see.Are you going to tape the shows?For my own personal archive, yeah.Moving on from the tour, do you still say that you're done making albums and just want to release singles?That still seems to be the plan. I haven't been super proactive with coming up with new material. Part of that is laziness and part of it is because I've had other things I'm working on. But regardless, I don't think I'm going to be doing any more studio albums. It just doesn't feel like the right direction for me. I like the flexibility and the freedom of just being able to put out songs as soon as I create them, instead of waiting until I have a dozen of them and then release them all at once. There's pros and cons to that. Albums are real events and you can center a lot of promotion and excitement around events. It's harder when you're just releasing material in drips and drabs. This feels very ironic coming off a Number One album, but I just don't feel like albums are the best way for me to get my stuff out there anymore.Have you been reading the song-by-song breakdown of your entire catalog on Nathan Rabin's website?I am, yeah. Nathan's an old friend and, or course, he co-wrote the book about me. I certainly appreciate his fandom. I've been reading those reviews every time he puts one out. It's great that somebody who is so well spoken and such a fan gets to write in-depth reviews of every song in my catalog.Did doing Comedy Bang! Bang! give you the TV bug again?I loved doing Comedy Bang! Bang! so much that as soon as it ended I was like, ""I want to do more sketch comedy, like a sketch comedy show."" But those are kind of hard to sell, so I'm not going to hold my breath for that happening. Also, I'm not an improv guy at all. Anything that's not rehearsed and scripted makes me a bit nervous, but doing that show, where there's a lot of improv, got me more comfortable doing a show where I go along with the flow. It's part of a lifelong process to get me to loosen up a bit.Do you see any timeline for when fans can expect to hear your next parody song?I've got no timeline in terms of writing, which is maybe not a great thing because I work better with a looming deadline. I can't tell you when any material is coming out. Inspiration could strike tomorrow and I might have something out next month. There's no plan. It's just going to be whenever it winds up being.You have real freedom now now that you don't have a record contract.It's nice to be able to do what I want and not feel beholden to anybody. My record label was very nice and offered me a pretty lucrative contract to re-sign with them when the contract ran out. It was tempting, but ultimately I just appreciated the freedom of not owing anybody anything, not feeling like I had to do something.It's hard to think of another artist that has had the same manager and the exact same band for their entire career.I've been very lucky. I work with extremely talented and very nice, down-to-earth people. We're a little family. Not many people are that lucky.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,Kory Grow,2018-02-06T23:01:00.000Z,Ozzy Osbourne Talks Final Tour: 'I'm Not Retiring',Ozzy Osbourne,Rolling Stone,"Half a century after&nbsp;Ozzy Osbourne&nbsp;launched his career with Black Sabbath and four decades since he went out on his own, the Prince of Bloody Darkness will embark on his final world tour.""Will it really have been 40 years that I've been solo?"" Osbourne&nbsp;ponders aloud. ""Yeah, I guess that's right. It's gone so quickly.""Dubbed ""No More Tours 2"" â€“ a cheeky throwback to his ill-fated retirement bid called ""No More Tours"" in the early Nineties â€“ Osbourne will kick off the two-year victory lap this spring with dates in Mexico, South America and Europe. The jaunt's first United States leg, which will feature Stone Sour as the opening group, starts in Allentown, Pennsylvania in August and wraps in Las Vegas in October. Tickets for the North American dates are on sale February 17th, with pre-sales beginning Valentine's Day.While the trek has all the markings of a farewell tour, Osbourne says that it's not the end for his career. ""I'm not retiring,"" he tells Rolling Stone on a call from his Los Angeles home. ""It's 'No More Tours,' so I'm just not doing world tours anymore. I'm still going to be doing gigs, but I'm not going on tour for six months at a time anymore. I'd like to spend some time at home.""The way he sees it, he's simply achieving balance in his life. ""I've experienced fantastic things; it's been an incredible journey,"" he says. ""I just need to slow it down a little."" And, he adds, after years of missing out on his children's milestones, he wants to be there more for the rest of his family. ""I enjoy being a grandfather,"" the singer, who recently became a granddad again, offers. ""I don't want to go through another generation of Osbournes without seeing them grow up.""That said, he's lost no passion for performing. ""If you know an Ozzy Osbourne concert, you know I don't stand there with my thumb up my butt,"" he deadpans. ""I'm rock &amp; roll. The more fun that [the fans] have, the more fun I have."" The band that will be backing him on the road includes his longtime guitar foil, Zakk Wylde, bassist Blasko, drummer Tommy Clufetos and keyboardist Adam Wakeman. ""Believe it or not,"" Zakk is the guitar player I've played with the longest since Sabbath,"" Osbourne says. ""I don't know what it is about him that works so well, but I'm very glad it does.""He's already thinking about the songs he wants to play on the No More Tours 2 trek. ""I haven't really sat down and written it down, but of course I have to do 'Paranoid' and 'Crazy Train,'"" he says. ""I want to do 'Mama, I'm Coming Home' and 'No More Tears.' I have a lot of songs to choose from. I was thinking about doing [Bark at the Moon's] 'Waiting for Darkness.' That's quite a good song to do. I've never done that onstage.""Did he learn anything from Black Sabbath's recent farewell tour? ""No,"" he says. ""Black Sabbath is a completely different thing. When I was in Black Sabbath, I was just a singer with a band called Black Sabbath. Now it's Ozzy Osbourne, and I have more control over what's going on than I did with Sabbath.""When the tour's done, he'll turn his attention back to possibly making a new album â€“ he has ""eight or nine good song ideas,"" he says â€“ and will do gigs as they come.""It's what I do,"" he says matter-of-factly. ""It's my job. And when I say, 'It's my job,' I mean it's a passion for me. It's the greatest love affair I ever had, being in a rock band and playing for the people who come to the shows.""Ozzy Osbourne Tour Dates4/27 - Jacksonville, FL @ Welcome to Rockville*  4/29 - Fort Lauderdale, FL @ FortRock * 8/30 - Allentown, PA @ PPL Center 9/1 - Syracuse, NY @ Lakeview Amphitheater 9/4 - Toronto, ON @ Budweiser Stage 9/6 - Boston, MA @ Xfinity Center 9/8 - Wantagh, NY @ Jones Beach Amphitheatre 9/10 - Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Arts Center 9/12 - Camden, NJ @ BB&amp;T Pavilion 9/14 - Bristow, VA @ Jiffy Lube Live 9/16 - Cuyahoga Falls OH @ Blossom Music Center 9/19 - Clarkston, MI @ DTE Energy Center 9/21 - Tinley Park, IL @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre 9/23 - Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center 9/26 - Dallas, TX @ Starplex Pavilion 9/28 - Houston, TX @ Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion 9/30 - Albuquerque, NM @ Isleta Amphitheater 10/2 - Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center 10/4 - Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA Amphitheatre 10/6 - Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre 10/9 - Chula Vista, CA @ Mattress Firm Amphitheatre 10/11 - Los Angeles, CA @ Hollywood Bowl 10/13 - Las Vegas, NV @ MGM Grand Garden Arena* Festival dates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,Rob Sheffield,2017-12-08T16:35:51.837Z,"Morrissey on Politics, David Bowie, What His Fans Taught Him","morrissey interview, morrissey, rob sheffield, morrissey solo, morrissey the smiths, the smiths, morrissey vegetarian, morrissey trump",Rolling Stone,"Thirty years after the Smiths ended, Morrissey carries on being his outrageously caustic self. The British rock legend just released a well-received new solo album, the mordantly witty Low in High School. He's spent most of the fall on an American tour, despite the usual controversies over his last-minute cancellations. He's been dusting off classics like the 1987 Smiths deep cut ""I Started Something I Couldn't Finish,"" which he'd never performed live until now. And true to form, he's kept busy all year offending vast numbers of people every time he opens his mouth, whether he's going off about terrorism or the royal family. (Shortly after Morrissey answered our questions, an interview appeared in the German news outlet Der Spiegel in which he seemed to express vague sympathy for Kevin Spacey. Morrissey has insisted he was misquoted.)&nbsp;It seems this Bigmouth never stops striking again. But he was mellow and reflective when he took time out from his current tour to answer a few of our questions via email, pondering music, politics and the legacy of his old friend David Bowie.Your new album is called Low in High School. Do you worry about young people today? Yes. With world leaders like Predicament Trump and Theresa May, we must wonder if the university generation actually had minds. This global hopelessness can only crush young people ... and perhaps that is the intent?Are you ever surprised you've kept your artistic inspiration burning for so long? No, because I haven't ever given myself over to the demoralizing aspects of marketing. I paddle my own canoe.Your music has always spoken to the young. Who are the young people who inspire you? They stare up and at me with every concert. We both know we're in the right place. There's nowhere else to be.Who are the humans you trust? Only those gone to their great reward. Of the living, I like those with an interesting blend of shyness and aggression. I couldn't ever trust anyone who ate animals, birds or fish.""Break Up the Family,"" from 1988 â€“ what a perfect song. Why isn't that song recognized as a classic? I think the same about ""Hold On to Your Friends,"" ""Let Me Kiss You,"" ""Alma Matters,"" ""Black Cloud,"" ""I'm Throwing My Arms Around Paris."" Other artists say absolutely nothing and are handed nine Grammys. It's debauched.If you could go back to one room you've left behind, what room would you return to? (And who would be there?) I dream constantly about my old bedroom in Manchester. I am always there, it is always 8:35 and time to walk to school, toppling into ditches of rain. Picture a swan being shot during flight.""My final aim is to abolish the abattoir.""What book or film or music have you recently discovered that you wished you'd discovered earlier? I was virtually blind at 14 from books and films. I left no stone unturned, and those were days when the efforts for discovery were something of a life sentence. Anything that happened was very, very slow, so therefore, the final effect of films, books, clothes, music created the full person.If David Bowie called on the cosmic telephone, what would you two talk about? He called many times on the terrestrial telephone. He must surely be happy now. Music is eternity, and there he is, now, very much in it. I don't imagine he wanted anything else from life.What kind of connection do you feel with your audience? We are full-blooded lovers. This is why I have decided to devote the rest of my life to lust. You reach a point in life where you must go further than just looking. It's all in the interest of science, of course.Have people evolved in any way during your lifetime? Meaning the human race, generally? Well, because of food enlightenment, yes â€“ it's clear to everyone how the dairy industry is a bigger threat to the planet that the nuclear arms race. People are sick of animal slaughter. My final aim is to abolish the abattoir, and although I haven't ever once voted in a general election, my vote awaits any party intelligent enough to ban the slaughterhouse. Only at that point would the world begin to grow up.Do you find it painful when fans thank you for changing their lives? (And if not, thank you.) They changed mine. And thank you!One final question: Does the body rule the mind, or does the mind rule the body? I dunno.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Jordan Runtagh,2017-12-06T20:03:00.000Z,Pop Virtuoso Andy Paley on His 'SpongeBob' Showstopper 'The Best Day Ever',"andy paley, spongebob, spongebob song, spongebob musical, andy paley brian wilson, best day ever, the best day ever, spongebob movie, voice of spongebob, andy paley Tom Kenny",Rolling Stone,"Andy Paley has co-written the most popular song in the history of SpongeBob SquarePants. That distinction might sound dubious, but to the franchise's legions of fans, ""The Best Day Ever"" â€“ originally heard during the closing credits of the 2004 SpongeBob movie â€“&nbsp; is a bona fide anthem.Now, the shimmering, deliriously euphoric song has wound up in the climactic spot of honor in SpongeBob SquarePants, The Broadway Musical, beating out tunes by the likes of David Bowie, John Legend and Steven Tyler, not to mention offerings from seasoned musical-theater pros like Cyndi ""Kinky Boots"" Lauper and Sara ""Waitress"" Bareilles. In more traditional Broadway terms, Paley has written the equivalent of ""Memories"" for an oversized anthropomorphic sponge.While a formidable achievement, it's possibly the least mind-boggling aspect of Paley's career. For more than 40 years, he has been something of a rock Zelig, witnessing musical history and working alongside a jukebox's worth of talent, from Jerry Lee Lewis to Madonna. His almost supernatural ability to sniff out catchy hooks ultimately led him to record with old masters Phil Spector and, perhaps most famously, Brian Wilson. He is a graduate of Rock 'n' Roll High School both conceptually â€“ he gigged at CBGB in its Seventies punk heyday when he wasn't touring with Patti Smith or Jonathan Richman â€“ and also literally, having performed with the Ramones on the soundtrack to that 1979 film. Paley's skills as a pop craftsman are obvious whether he's writing songs for the guy who made Pet Sounds, or for a children's series. ""I think a song's a song,"" Paley tells Rolling Stone. ""With those SpongeBob songs, we try to make them so it's not specifically for the cartoon. We really want them to be universal."" His involvement with the Nickelodeon juggernaut began when NRBQ drummer Tom Ardolino introduced him to future collaborator Tom Kenny (a.k.a., the voice of SpongeBob) at an L.A. show. Together they shared an encyclopedia of musical references, plus Paley's extensive Rolodex of guest musicians. Who else would tap James Burton, Elvis Presley's longtime guitarist, to play on a song (""You Will Obey"") sung by an animated piece of plankton, complete with a tossed-off ""Take it, James,"" Ã  la the King? Coming of age in the mid-Sixties, Paley escaped the boredom of upstate New York by cruising his transistor dial in search of songs by the Ronettes, the Shirelles or the Miracles. ""The records just jumped out of the radio, and there was great variety on the AM radio back then,"" he says of those formative sounds. By the Seventies he was making music of his own as a member of Boston-based group the Sidewinders. After their debut failed to break through, he formed a new duo, the Paley Brothers, with his brother Jonathan. Despite production help from a young Jimmy Iovine, their first EP â€“ a 4-track set of unabashedly poppy songs in the vein of Big Star â€“ was largely ignored.&nbsp;Still, Paley's Brill Buildingâ€“esque songwriting and Wall of Sound arrangements earned the admiration of his hero, Phil Spector, who called Paley's apartment at 3 a.m. one morning in the late Seventies. ""I didn't believe it, I thought it was a friend of mine messing around and then I realized it was him,"" Paley remembers. ""He said, 'I heard this EP by you and your brother. I was wondering if you'd come out to L.A. and see if we could work together.'"" Within weeks they were at the legendary Gold Star Studios, Spector's favorite haunt, working with the same crew of musicians who'd cut the records that first sparked Paley's creativity. The result of the session, ""Baby Let's Stick Together,"" would remain unissued for decades, but the experience would prepare him well for working with Spector's best-known disciple, Brian Wilson. Appointed by Sire Records chief Seymour Stein, Paley co-wrote and co-produced Wilson's first solo album, 1988's Brian Wilson, at a time when the Beach Boys leader's genius was emerging from a thicket of drug abuse and mental illness. Considering that Paley had eagerly followed the band around on tour years earlier, his promotion from super-fan to collaborator was a happy one. The partnership pushed Wilson toward his most ambitious work in decades, including the eight-minute epic, ""Rio Grande."" Paley occasionally primed Wilson's pump by presenting semi-completed songs. ""I'd leave out the bridge on purpose [for example] just because I wanted to see what he'd come up with,"" he says. ""And he loved it."" The album&nbsp;was lauded as a critical triumph, and the pair continued to work together through the Nineties. Though widely bootlegged, the bulk of their later material remains officially unreleased due in part to the legal quagmire that resulted when Wilson extricated himself from his tyrannical therapist, Eugene Landy. ""I believe that all the stuff he and I wrote together will see the light of day,"" Paley says. ""I know he loves it and I love it.""Glimpses of the Beach Boys' sky-high harmonies, infectious melodies and toe-tapping descending bass lines are apparent on ""The Best Day Ever."" After turning up in the&nbsp;SpongeBob SquarePants Movie credits, the tune got its time to shine on an episode of the TV show, a soundtrack album and now the Broadway production.&nbsp;""It's gratifying to see that song have a second, or third or fourth life,"" Paley says. ""It seems to keep coming up.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,David Fricke,2017-10-31T13:51:37.734Z,Remembering Frank Zappa's Epic 1977 Halloween Shows,"frank zappa, david fricke, frank zappa halloween, frank zappa palladium, frank zappa 1977, frank zappa box set, ",Rolling Stone,"I missed the birth of a tradition â€“ the advanced, instrumental ecstasy, cliff-edge improvisation and impromptu theatrical hijinks of Frank Zappa's annual Halloween concerts in New York City â€“ by less than a week and a 90-minute drive. On November 5th, 1974, I saw Zappa in performance for the first time in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in a drafty livestock showroom on the Allentown Fairgrounds. The composer was leading the Mothers featured on that year's live document, Roxy &amp; Elsewhere, and they were â€“ under his firm direction, despite the dire setting and matching acoustics â€“ in thrilling military-drilled form. Six days earlier, Zappa celebrated his first Halloween in New York â€“ after '72 and '73 stands in Passaic, New Jersey, and Chicago respectively â€“ with early and late shows of two hours each that established the city as Zappa's mischief-night headquarters into the mid-Eighties. The repertoire on that night in '74 spanned his entire, winding history in provocation and incisive adventure, going back to jump street â€“ 1966's Freak Out! â€“ via the jazzy expanse of ""Big Swifty"" from 1972's The Grand Wazoo and the devious accessibility of the '74 chart shock, Apostrophe ('). During the second set, Zappa also hit the trick-as-treat button, bringing Lance Loud â€“ the aspiring glam-rock star and breakout gay icon from the protoâ€“reality TV series, An American Family â€“ onstage to join the vocal shenanigans. In 1977, after three years of Halloween at the Felt Forum, Zappa moved to the Fillmore Eastâ€“style atmosphere of the Palladium (formerly the Academy of Music). He also added shows to the run: six marathons over four nights, with the last two concerts on October 30th and 31st hitting the three-hour mark without intermission. As Zappa told the packed and delirious crowd early on the 31st, introducing the helium falsetto of an original Mother, guest vocalist Roy Estrada, in a ""glam-rock opera"" about a sexually aroused rubber mask: ""You don't want to have a regular Halloween, do ya? You want the best. You deserve the best. You're gonna get the best."" Forty years on â€“ and nearly a quarter-century after Zappa's passing in 1993 â€“ ""the best"" has been unleashed in full by the Zappa Family Trust. Halloween 77: The Palladium, NYC (Zappa Records) is a digital-age box with the six concerts from introduction to encores, packed onto a USB stick packaged as a candy bar and accompanied by a Zappa mask and saucy T-shirt for masquerade enthusiasts. Non-completists and those on a budget can get the climax of the engagement on a three-CD set, Halloween 77: October 31st, 1977, with bonus tracks from the 30th (including a rare detour that week into Zappa's signature instrumental ""King Kong""). ""By the end of a performance,"" guitarist Adrian Belew writes in his liner notes, ""I remember that happily-drained feeling. No more to give ...""  This was, in fact, a band primed for giving, under Zappa's strict, exuberant command: drummer Terry Bozzio and Patrick O'Hearn, precocious-fusion furies and comparative Zappa veterans of a year-and-change; keyboard players Tommy Mars and Peter Wolf; percussionist Ed Mann; and Belew, then on his first tour with Zappa and discovered by the latter earlier that year at a club gig in Nashville. Belew's single year with Zappa would kick off the guitarist's rapid ascent in the late Seventies and Eighties: next with David Bowie, then in Talking Heads and King Crimson. Mars and Mann would stay with Zappa, on record and the road, in various lineups, until the end of his touring life in 1988. Zappa arrived at the Palladium in October 1977 under heavy legal weather. A deteriorating relationship with Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his DiscReet label, reached an infuriating low that year when Warner Bros. refused to release Zappa's next intended release, a four-LP anthology of new and archival work, LÃ_ther. When Zappa took the set to Mercury, planning to release it under his new Zappa Records imprint, Warner Bros. claimed rights to the recordings. Zappa was forced to carve that material across a series of separate LPs for the company while building a new album from scratch.The Palladium shows were the start of that next record, 1978's Sheik Yerbouti. In his liner notes, Belew cites ""two- and three-hour soundchecks which were thinly disguised recording sessions"" for the album. Two performances from that week of ""Jones Crusher"" and ""Jewish Princess"" were included on the '78 double LP. Other Sheik Yerbouti songs that appeared nightly in the set lists included the galloping cynicism of ""Broken Hearts Are for Assholes""; the breakneck sequence of ""Tryin' to Grow a Chin"" and ""City of Tiny Lites""; and Zappa's biggest hit anywhere, the gleefully scabrous ""Bobby Brown."" Issued as a single in 1979, it inexplicably went to Number One in Norway and Sweden. (A personal milestone: Sheik Yerbouti, completed with live recordings from Europe in early 1978, was the first album I ever reviewed for Rolling Stone.) Zappa was also filming the Palladium concerts for what would become, with Bruce Bickford's stop-motion clay animation, the 1979 film, Baby Snakes. At one point in the Halloween show, someone in the crowd complained about the glare of the house lights. ""We can't turn off the lights,"" Zappa replied, ""because we're making movies of you."" ""Frank was the hardest working artist I have ever known,"" Belew writes, ""fueled by constant caffeine and cigarettes, and we tried our best to keep up with him."" Zappa, in turn, summarized his working methods and commitment this way, when I interviewed him in 1979 for the magazine Trouser Press: ""I just do mine for me and people who happen to like it."" Halloween 77, in both variations, captures Zappa in a late-Seventies outlaw prime: ignoring critical brickbats and serving a devout cult audience as he fires lethal lampoons of social self-righteousness and pop-culture jive through mock-Fifties grease, propulsive jazz-rock and roiling avant-instrumental challenge. There is surprising vintage material (""Big Leg Emma,"" a 1967 non-LP single with the early Mothers); the crushing send-up of the glam-rock band Angel in ""Punky's Whips""; and ""The Black Page #2,"" a daunting, percussive composition named after the opaque density of Zappa's written notation. ""Wild Love,"" which ultimately lasted four minutes on Sheik Yerbouti, goes for half an hour at every show, with Zappa generously spreading the soloing time around. He keeps one guitar showcase, ""Conehead"" â€“ eight minutes of overdriven harmonics and Hot Ratsâ€“fusion slalom â€“ for himself. There is a special encore gift on Halloween too: Zappa's only outing that week on the Zoot Allures guitar-solo monster ""Black Napkins."" I missed it all, by just a few days, in 1974. I didn't make that mistake again after moving to New York in 1978, celebrating Halloween week in the city with Zappa that year and then as often as fortune allowed until he retired the tradition, back at the Felt Forum, in 1984. When I interviewed Zappa in 1980 for Circus magazine, after the release of Baby Snakes, he characterized the film â€“ and, by extension, the 1977 Palladium action in it â€“ as ""a statement on what people missed in the Seventies. You know the history of rock &amp; roll, how in the Fifties everybody was cool and in the Sixties everybody was crazy and in the Seventies everybody was dull? This movie proves that not everybody was dull."" Here, at last, is the soundtrack â€“ all of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,Kory Grow,2017-11-16T17:03:00.000Z,Black Sabbath Reflect on 'The End': 'It Was So Weird Saying Goodbye',"black sabbath,black sabbath interview,ozzy osbourne interview,geezer butler interview,tony iommi interview,black sabbath the end,ozzy osbourne the end,tony iommi the end,angelic sessions,black sabbath changes",Rolling Stone,"It ended as it began â€“ only bigger. Nearly 50 years after Black Sabbath formed in Birmingham, England, they played the final show of their farewell tour there this past February. During the gig, they revisited many of the colossal blues rockers they wrote in the late Sixties â€“ numbers like ""N.I.B.,"" ""Behind the Wall of Sleep"" and the crushing dirge that changed everything for them, ""Black Sabbath"" â€“ but something about seeing them play these songs, bleached in pyro, felt larger than life. This was the band that codified heavy metal, from its foreboding chord changes to its obsession with death, throwing its own funeral. Somehow it felt more like a celebration, even if the band members were holding back their feelings.""It was very emotional,"" Ozzy Osbourne tells Rolling Stone, months later, a sense of amazement still in his voice. ""Sharon would be like, 'Say something.' I couldn't speak. Because I thought if I start talking I'll end up in fucking tears. That's hardly the Prince of Darkness, being seen crying."" He laughs.""When you're onstage, seeing the audience, and there's people out there crying, it was all sorts of emotions,"" guitarist Tony Iommi says. ""It was really great to see all these people from all over the world, and to see everybody's faces. But it was also emotional, because it's the last time you're going to be seeing these people.""A new concert film and live album, The End, captures every teary moment â€“ as well as every weighty note the band played in Birmingham â€“ along with some extra surprises. After playing ""Iron Man,"" ""War Pigs"" and ""Snowblind"" for a final time at the gig, the band regrouped at the nearby Angelic Recording Studio a few days later to play five additional numbers that weren't on the tour set list, including the first original they ever wrote (""Wicked World""), that they filmed and have dubbed ""The Angelic Sessions."" The project as a whole, which was directed by Dick Carruthers and is different from the filmmaker's recently released The End of the End documentary, presents a final, stunning snapshot of the band. (Disclosure: I wrote liner notes for the release.)Now that half a year has passed, the band members each have 20/20 hindsight about the experience. Which isn't to say that when they speak with Rolling Stone any of them but Iommi have watched the film (""I fucking hate to see myself on TV,"" Osbourne says, and bassist Geezer Butler echoes that sentiment); nevertheless, the guitarist, who worked on the film's sound mix, says the experience of the farewell tour was ""fantastic,"" and they're all happy with how it ended. ""I'm glad we finished on a high note,"" Butler concurs. And he adds, drolly, ""I'm glad that it's finished now.""The band announced the goodbye trek in 2015. Iommi had been diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012, preceding the recording of their comeback album 13, and after a demanding tour supporting the record ended, the band reached an impasse: either spend an indefinite amount of time making a follow-up or hit the road. They opted for the latter. ""I can't actually do this anymore,"" Iommi said of the farewell in 2015. ""My body won't take it much more."" With original drummer Bill Ward out of the picture due to a contract dispute, they regrouped with touring stickman Tommy Clufetos and keyboardist-guitarist Adam Wakeman and brought ""The End,"" as the tour was known, around the world for a little more than a year.""There's always some kind of anxiety before you go on for most of the shows, certainly when you're in New York, L.A., London or Birmingham,"" Iommi says. ""All of them are important, but we always get a little bit anxious on certain shows. For the final show, we felt really nervous. I know everyone was feeling that way when they were walking down the hallway to go onstage. It's like going to be hung."" To get over his jitters, the guitarist would play for a bit, have a bite, listen to some soft music and take a nap before getting ready to hit the stage. ""Tommy would come around at about 8 o'clock, usually on the dot, and say good luck,"" he says, ""and then Ozzy would storm in at some point."" Similarly Butler would get some sleep, do some yoga and ""go to the bathroom about 10 times,"" and Osbourne would warm up his voice in his dressing room. The four would do a huddle and hit the stage.Playing the final gig put Osbourne in what he calls ""a real weird place."" ""I was physically there, but I remember thinking, 'Fucking hell. What a tour this has been,'"" he says. Despite the occasion, the band didn't do anything special together to toast their careers after the final notes of ""Paranoid"" rung out for what could be the last time. ""I'm the only one who drinks,"" Iommi says. ""So the only celebration was after the show; we had some of our friends there. But as a band we didn't get time to talk to each other. We knew we'd planned to get together a couple of days after to do these [recording] sessions, and I'm really glad we did that. I'm glad there was time to talk to each other and say goodbye really.""The sessions were also a chance for the musicians to revisit some old songs they hadn't played in a long time. When they originally picked the set list for the final tour, each band member made his own list and sent it to the others. The first cut was about 30 songs, and they pared it down from there. ""There's certain songs that you can never drop,"" Butler says. ""We tried dropping 'Iron Man' once, and people were going mental about it, so we had to put it back in.""""You can only do what Ozzy can do,"" Iommi says, ""because a lot of the old songs were really high, so doing those is impossible. There's no point in putting down 'Symptom of the Universe' and 'Hole in the Sky.'""""I have to get my balls in a vice to do them songs,"" Osbourne says with a laugh. ""My range hasn't gotten any higher over the years. Some songs are too low, some are too high. When I listen to a song like 'Hole in the Sky,' I go, 'What the fuck was I thinking?'"" The band ended up playing a few of its greatest riffs without Osbourne at the Birmingham show, captured in the film, including ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" and ""Megalomania.""So while the majority of The End's track list contains songs from the group's first four LPs, including a hearty six-song helping of Paranoid in addition to Technical Ecstasy's Iommi showcase ""Dirty Women,"" the band attempted some of the other material at the Angelic session. Among the selections were the bluesy Osbourne harmonica showcase ""The Wizard,"" the marijuana ode ""Sweet Leaf"" and a brilliant rendition of the piano-and-synthesizer ballad ""Changes."" ""I thought if we did these after the Birmingham show, Ozzy wouldn't be panicking about losing his voice,"" Iommi says.For the singer, doing these songs was a special treat. ""When we decided to do some jamming for the DVD thing, I gave it my fucking all,"" he says. ""I did three songs without stopping and I'm like, 'Fucking hell.' It's really cool.""""We didn't rehearse anything for the sessions,"" Butler says. ""We were all sort of coming down from the whole Birmingham thing, and we wanted to get out as quickly as possible. I think we work best that way. The first four albums were done straight off the cuff.""The bassist says he vied for the group to do ""Sweet Leaf"" originally for the tour but it didn't make the cut. ""I always wanted to do that, since I think it's one of the best Sabbath songs,"" he says. ""And we hadn't really done 'Wicked World' since we wrote it in this old derelict pub in Birmingham not long after Tony came back from his thing with Jethro Tull. We only ever played 'Changes' once onstage, at the Hollywood Bowl in 1972, but when we did it the Mellotron was all out of tune and it sounded like the biggest disaster ever.""Revisiting ""Changes"" in particular proved to be nerve-racking for the bassist. When the band recorded the song for the group's 1972 LP Vol. 4, Iommi had just split with his girlfriend at the time and was feeling down. He was playing the piano part, Osbourne started singing along, and Butler wrote song lyrics; then the bassist pulled out a Mellotron and played some chords underneath it. At Angelic, Butler says he was surprised the band was intending to do it. ""Someone said, 'Let's do ""Changes,""' and I said, 'Who's going to play the Mellotron?'"" he recalls. ""They said, 'You, since you played it on the record.' I still made mistakes on it â€“ it's not exactly the same as the record â€“ but I nearly got through it. We did only one take."" When the sessions were done, though, the band members didn't know how to leave off with one another. For a little over a year, when they'd bid each other farewell, they'd be looking forward to the next leg of the tour. ""It was so weird saying goodbye after the sessions,"" Iommi says. ""Nobody really knew what to say to each other. It was a bit embarrassing really. I think we just sort of said, 'All right, I'm going.'""The guitarist says the three band members have been in touch via email and text since then (""Geezer doesn't like being on the phone,"" he says, ""and Ozzy lasts about three second on the phone"") but that they have each been busy with their individual projects. He likes the idea of doing a one-off gig with the other band members at some point â€“ ""but who knows,"" he says. He hasn't been working on anything of his own, since he's been so busy with preparing The End, and that he's ""sort of open for anything, really."" Since the final show, Butler has moved houses, ""so I've been bloody unpacking crap for the last six months,"" and he isn't in a rush to release any new solo music. Despite this, he says he has ""about 120 riffs written down and I've just got to pick a guitarist and sort through them."" He says he too would love to do a one-off Sabbath gig if the right opportunity came up. ""If it were up to me, we'd still be touring now,"" he says. ""It was because Tony's illness that we limited it to 81 dates. I would have gone on forever, if I was allowed to. If a one-off worked out, I'd be on board. Otherwise I'm happy to let things lie.""Osbourne, however, is plotting his own solo farewell tour. ""They've retired, but I haven't,"" he says. ""It's like I'm jumping off one boat onto another."" That said, he hasn't decided yet if he'll make another solo album. ""I've written a couple of songs, but I go, 'Do I want to go through with it?'"" he says. ""You don't sell that many records anymore. Nobody does."" (He does report, however that he's enjoyed reuniting with guitarist Zakk Wylde, whom he compares to a ""whirling dervish â€“ he's so fucking fast."")When the three of them look back on Sabbath's career, though, they do so with little regrets. ""When I think of all the things we've done, whether good or bad, I think there's a reason for everything,"" Iommi says. ""I think if you change anything, it wouldn't be what it is today. There's things you regret, like the legal stuff, and the drugs and everything, but without that we might not be what we are today.""""You can't regret anything, because we all live great lives,"" Butler says. ""If we had been millionaires in 1971, we would have probably killed ourselves; we would have probably bought a million dollars' worth of heroin. So you have to think of it like that. The drugs were what they were. They helped us. It was like four blokes going to the pub, but instead of going to the pub and having a good laugh, we were in a big mansion having a laugh with a lot of dope and groupies. The only regrets I have would be financially in the early Seventies; I would have gotten a lawyer and an accountant. But that's fate.""""What I was really proud of was we were four guys from a place called Aston, Birmingham, and it opened the doors to the best fucking gig that anyone could ever have,"" Osbourne says. ""And to boot, sitting here nearly 50 years later, we're looked at as one of the icons of our time. I have a problem getting my head around that. It sometimes seems like my time with Sabbath was longer than my time on my own. As I get older, time gets faster for some reason. The saddest thing was it didn't work out with Bill Ward. I would have loved that, but hey, it's done now.""That finality is something that's still registering with some of the band members. Iommi says he feels as though he's still on tour since he's been working on the concert film. And despite focusing on his solo career again, Osbourne says he's still parsing the feeling he got being back in his hometown. ""I could remember sitting in a van going to London from Birmingham with the rest of the guys, and then after 49 years, back in Birmingham, with the band,"" he says. ""What a fucking journey, man.""Butler says it took him about a month after he got home for it to sink in that the band had played a final show. ""You think it's never going to come and suddenly it's there, and you've finished,"" he says. ""It's just too much to take in at the time. During the gig, you're just thinking about if you're going to make a mistake or that your amps will blow up or something, and it's hard to realize it's going to be the last day of the gig. It wasn't until I got home, when all the hype was over, that I thought, 'Oh, yeah, that's it. That's the end.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Right Said Fred you know he is too sexy for a dozen things, and in a week I can memorize that.""The song's upbeat vibe and simple, percussive lyrics helped it implant itself in the minds of Top 40 radio listeners, hitting Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks. Since then, it's been a cultural touchstone, the declaration of being ""too sexy"" for something now part of the American pop cultural fabric. It received a lyrical shout-out from Jay-Z on his era-defining 2001 LP The Blueprint, was part of the dialogue on&nbsp;The West Wing, soundtracked The Smurfs 2 and added a touch of glitter absurdity to a pitch for the Toyota Camry. Its profile recently roared back to life when Taylor Swift's Number One hit ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" interpolated the ticky-tack vocal rhythm that helped make it catchphrase-ready. Brothers Richard and Fred Fairbrass, the British music lifers who came up with the song after living through New York's go-go Eighties, still perform the song at retro-minded festivals today. Here, the Fairbrass brothers and other characters discuss the song's improbable rise to the top. Fred Fairbrass, Right Said Fred: We never really fit in. When everyone else was doing post-punk New Wave, we were busy doing sort of ... acoustic power-pop. Which just didn't fit. We toured with Suicide and with Joy Division. We were just on the road in the U.K. mostly, from '78, '79 right through to when we moved to New York in '86, '87. Like most musicians, we had part-time jobs â€“ we worked in video production, we both worked in gyms. People always thought we were going to do something, and we never did. I saw a documentary on Twisted Sister and there were quite a few â€_ parallels with things that went wrong, yeah. People falling out and people becoming ill or just moving out of the country. You sign to somebody then they get picked up by another company and you're left with an A&amp;R guy that hates you. All the stuff bands go through. What was interesting about New York in that period, it was very hedonistic. Big parties like [the drag hangout] Jackie 60. Richard worked at [nightclub] Nell's. I worked at [the punk-rock clothier] Trash and Vaudeville. We just did a load of stuff â€“ we went to a lot of really dodgy parties.Richard Fairbrass, Right Said Fred: Every party was dodgy.Fred Fairbrass: So when we got back to London, we started writing slightly different stuff. A bit more cynical and lyrically cynical. ""I'm Too Sexy"" was the first song we'd wrote with this guy we'd met, a guitarist named Rob Manzoli. We told Rob, ""We've been through the mill. We don't want to use anything that we've written before. We want to write a brand-new song. No old ideas, nothing.""Richard Fairbrass: We'd got really bored with acoustic music.Fred Fairbrass: And musicians.Richard Fairbrass: Really, we just wanted a beat and ...Fred Fairbrass: And keep it cheap. â€_ We started programming with Brian [Pugsley]. We had this song going around which was a bass line and we were trying to write a melody. But the bass line was actually the ""I'm Too Sexy"" melody. ... We had had a few drinks and stuff and Richard jumped up and was walking around Brian's flat, and then came back into the studio with his shirt off. Because we had been down at the gym, we were training quite hard and we were in quite good shape. He took his shirt off and started singing ""I'm too sexy for my shirt"" to the bass line. Rob and Richard thought it was very funny. I was less convinced initially. I thought, ""This is a bit of a stupid idea.""Richard Fairbrass: He's a Bob Dylan fan, that's why. Sense of humor bypassed him.Fred Fairbrass: No, Bob Dylan's got a great sense of humor.Phil Spalding, bass: When you listen to ""I'm Too Sexy,"" the bass strings sound like rubber bands. I'm a really hard player â€“ I really hit the guitars I play. And when you tune a bass down [by a fifth], you can't hit it so hard. I did it in one take, so what you hear on the record is me playing from beginning to end. And I made it up as I went along. If you actually analyze it and listen to it, there's loads of places where I'm pulling the bass out of tune, because the strings are too loose. Every time I hit it hard, it goes a bit sharp.Fred Fairbrass: We then hooked up with Ian Craig Marsh, who had worked with Heaven 17. Richard Fairbrass: And that was the first time I had ever heard sampled brass. I didn't even know you could do that.Fred Fairbrass:  We knew it needed a bit more of a beat to it. â€_ I knew a DJ named Tommy D, and we took the song to him and he basically created a new backing track. There was a studio we found that was actually gone into receivership, so it was closed. But if you gave the janitor guy some money, he'd open it up at night, on the understanding you didn't put any lights on and you didn't put on the heating.Richard Fairbrass: And it was freezing.Fred Fairbrass: We had to work from the lights that came off the equipment and the little spotlights in the studio.Fred Fairbrass: Finally, we started playing the song to some record companies and all the record companies said, ""No."" Every single label said, ""Yeah, this isn't going to work."" And we just thought, ""They're not right."" â€_ But then there was Red Bus Studios in London, and their receptionist heard the song. She said to us, ""I'll tell you what, I think this is a hit record. â€_ If I can get this on the radio, I want to manage it."" She was only 18, 17? A real young kid. But really ballsy and a lot of spark about her. We said, ""Hey, if you can get us on the radio, you can manage us. Take your 20 percent, we'd be happy.""Tamzin Aronowitz, manager/PR, Right Said Fred: I knew [record promoter] Guy Holmes through the record company that I was working for. I persuaded him to give me a lift home. â€_ And then I just put the cassette in his car and we had a listen to it on the way back. He loved it, he jumped from it. Fred Fairbrass: Fortunately, Simon [Bates, BBC Radio 1 DJ] and his producer were very open-minded, and they played ""I'm Too Sexy"" off the acetate, and the phones went mental. The audience were A&amp;R, if you like, and we had no record deal. So we formed a little independent label with the plugger to service this one record. We didn't sign a deal, it was just a handshake, really. A gentleman's agreement. And from that moment, the record just went insane.We were funding everything â€“ we borrowed the money through friends and a bank loan. And the record just started going mad. It just had a life of its own, like ""Gangnam Style"" or ""Moves Like Jagger"" â€“ these big songs that come out of nowhere. The minute it got onto radio, it just started getting massive numbers. It broke everywhere on import, even before it was licensed [to Charisma Records].Joe Cortese, host, Retro Pop Reunion; DJ and producer, CBS Radio: The UK is always about six to eight months ahead of us for trends and fashion and music. And when I first heard ""I'm Too Sexy,"" I thought it was a novelty song. Others thought it might have been another Milli Vanilli, after that debacle.When it came out, music was kind of tripping on itself, and the times were kind of in a tailspin. And there was this fun song that came out. People were calling for it because it had a great beat, and then the 12-inch mixes started coming out. And people's immediate reaction was, ""Yeah, can you play that song? Can you play that song?"" Because at that time, the only place you could get that song [in the U.S.] was radio.Fred Fairbrass: It just went insane. We weren't promoting the song; we were trying to catch up with it. It's the first time I've ever just experienced being chased by that whole mania thing â€“ being chased by girls and storming hotels. All this craziness, which we actually didn't like, I've got to be honest with you.Richard Fairbrass: I don't think we were very good at it, actually.Aronowitz: It was a learning curve, definitely, for all of us. Nobody expected it to go so big. I think we did our own PR to begin with. It was just literally me sitting at my desk when I should've been working and phoning up all the old pop magazines like Smash Hits. â€_ All the costumes they wore, were actually by an incredible stylist named Peter Hawker. He was putting them in all these crazy, outrageous bubble-wrap costumes. People had never seen anything like it.Fred Fairbrass: As I said, we'd just come back from New York. It was making fun, if you like, of that hedonism. People forget now how famous Cindy Crawford was.Richard Fairbrass: And Christie Brinkley.Fred Fairbrass: And Jerry Hall. Just big, big stars. ""Sexy"" was not really making fun of those people, but making fun of people who thought they were those people. Because we delivered it with our shirts off, we had actually had people think that we ...Richard Fairbrass: Thought we actually thought that we were too sexy. They didn't get it.Fred Fairbrass: They didn't get the cynicism and the joke. But the idea of the song is that obviously you can't be too sexy, right? No one can be too sexy.&nbsp;Cortese: Everybody kind of attached their own emoji to ""I'm Too Sexy,"" right down to, ""I'm too sexy for my coffee.""Richard Fairbrass: It became a part of the language, in a way â€“ it wasn't just a song anymore. I think people use that expression even if they've never heard the song.Aronowitz: We did a big tour of the States, about six weeks. This was when ""I'm Too Sexy"" had just broken over there. I've probably done bigger and better things, but we were driving around in vans going to local radio and plugging away and doing â€_ shopping centers all over the place. God knows how many states we went to â€“ it was mad. It was so big. It was literally a different plane and a different city every day.Richard Fairbrass: I remember a gig in America where, when we got to the gig, the carpark was full of motorbikes.Fred Fairbrass: It was Austin, Texas.Richard Fairbrass: Wally, our tour manager, said, ""This could be a bit rough â€“ this is a biker's place, you know?"" I at the time was wearing almost a semi-see-through body stocking thing. I thought, ""We are going to get absolutely murdered in this place. This is going to be a nightmare."" And they loved it.Richard Fairbrass: It was the first time we'd ever made any money, so we had a holiday in Saint Lucia. There was loads and loads of homophobia in Saint Lucia at the time, so we decided to leave. We were catching a plane back, sitting in this funny little airport. The phone on the wall rang in the airport, and somebody picked up the phone and said, ""Is Right Said Fred here?"" â€_ That's where we found out we were Number One. We heard the official Billboard announcement on the radio when we were in Florida.Fred Fairbrass: We were channel surfing and we found this local Miami station, and it was just as we'd got there that he said, ""Now, America's Number One is Right Said Fred."" We'd just tuned in about five seconds before the guy said it. I have to say, that was the first moment I thought, ""Fuck! That was actually pretty amazing."" An independent band with no money, making it. â€_ Some bands had to get there if they've got a huge amount of debt from a major label. And they spend the next 10 years trying to pay it off. We were incredibly lucky, because everything we made was profit. Because we hadn't spent any money. We didn't have any.Aronowitz: I had my 21st birthday on tour in America with the band; I had to show my passport to get a drink. I think they were celebrating being Number One, and I was going, ""Yeah, I am now 21, I can now officially have a glass of something to celebrate!""Cortese: It was an across-the-board hit. At the time, you had grunge, gangsta rap, as well as Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, very soft AC. And then you had this pulverizing song that really stood out. It was a party anthem for the times.Richard Fairbrass: A friend and I came out of a diner in the middle of nowhere, and walking towards us across the carpark were these two heavily leather clad blokes who had just got off their Harleys. They both dropped to their knees and did the whole ""We're not worthy"" thing! And we had never seen Wayne's World. I didn't know what ""We're not worthy"" was! I had no idea.Fred Fairbrass: To have an artist as big as Taylor Swift give you the thumbs up and introduce us to her fan base is amazing. â€_ ""I like the cynical aspect of the lyric [in ""Look What You Made Me Do""], because ""I'm Too Sexy"" is a cynical song, and I think she channeled that quite well. â€_ She and Jack [Antonoff, producer] sent us flowers â€_ with a big thank you and said they want to meet at a party and celebrate. So we'll hold them to that.""Richard Fairbrass: It also proves the point that 'Sexy' wasn't just a ludicrous 'Purple People Eater' kind of nonsense song. There was more to it than that.Fred Fairbrass: ""I'm Too Sexy"" is one of those songs that, now, DJs and record company people all claim to be part of, and they were nowhere near it. ""Oh man, I wish you'd played me that record!"" Yeah, yeah, whatever, mate. Your label said ""No."" We now meet people all the time who claim that they were part of it, and we don't remember them. But it's one of those songs that has a mythology point as well.Richard Fairbrass: I think the weird thing with it was, it was a song that punters really liked, the public really liked, people really liked. But it was a song that irritated some musicians incredibly, because it was perceived to be stupid. Simple. Daft. Not serious. Even now, some musicians definitely look down their nose at us. I think if our first record had been all about personal pain and suffering, we would be taken a lot more seriously as musicians. But that's just the way it is. And it's their problem more than ours.Additional reporting by Kory Grow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,Kory Grow,2017-12-20T17:09:21.076Z,"Serj Tankian Talks New Film Scores, Chris Cornell, What's Next For System of a Down","serj tankian interview,serj tankian vocals,serj tankian,serj tankian system of a down,system of a down break up,system of a down status,serj tankian chris cornell,serj tankian new music,serj tankian new,serj tankian soundtrack",Rolling Stone,"Reports of Serj Tankian never wanting to sing again are greatly exaggerated. Earlier this month, news spread that the System of a Down frontman was interested only in instrumental music now and that in an interview he'd even said, ""Screw vocals."" When he thinks about that story now, he laughs.""That was from an interview I'd done, like, five or six months ago when I was in Moscow doing press for the movie Furious â€“ The Legend of Kolovrat, which I did the score for,"" he says. ""I don't remember saying 'screw vocals,' but it may have been when they were showing the film and someone was asking me about vocals, and I said something like, 'Screw the vocals, look at the screen.' What's funny is I'm doing all these vocal sessions this week. How about that?""The day before speaking with Rolling Stone, the singer recorded vocals for a track on Mindless Self Indulgence frontman Jimmy Urine's upcoming solo album. On the night of the chat, he's singing a song for System of a Down drummer (and Tankian's brother-in-law) John Dolmayan's These Grey Men side project. ""It's like vocal week for me,"" he says with a laugh. ""It's not that I don't ever want to sing. It's just that I'm focused on doing film music more than anything right now. It's where I'm really feeling the muse come.""This year, Tankian scored two films and released soundtrack albums for each. The documentary Intent to Destroy explores how for more than a century the Turkish government has denied that the Armenian Genocide ever took place, and it features a shadowy, nuanced score. Meanwhile, the Russian-language Furious is an action film about a 13th-century battle, which allowed Tankian to create majestic tapestries of choirs, symphony, electric guitar and Tuvan throat singing. He's currently working on music for Spitak, a Russian-Armenian co-production about the Armenian earthquake of 1988. ""It's a really heavy film,"" he says. ""I'm writing a modern-sounding score with very light pianos and ethereal soundscapes for this one. It's very dreamy, sometimes dark, sometimes bright. I'm halfway through it."" Tankian has a few others on the docket for the coming year too.""It's easy to write a rock song for me because I've done it for 25 fucking years,"" he explains. ""And if something comes up and I feel like it needs a rock instrumentation for the emotions to be conveyed, I'll write another rock song, but if that's not what I'm feeling, then I'm not.""Despite feeling some annoyance about how his previous interview was taken out of context, Tankian is in good spirits when he speaks with RS. ""I'm a little nervous but good,"" says the singer, who is at home in California. ""There are fucking fires everywhere."" Nevertheless, he says he's carrying out his day-to-day routines as usual, which of course is centered around writing music.Is composing your full-time musical endeavor these days? Mostly, yeah. It's vocal week for me now, but mostly I've been scoring and doing back-to-back films. And it's been great, because each film is a completely different type of music, depending on the type of film it is with the tempo and the emotion. So you end up making something more diverse than you would if you were making records. What is your process with film soundtracks? I get as much information as possible about a project. I'll look at a script and get the vibe of it and chat with the director, so I know what's in his or her mind in terms of music and instrumentation, as well as the emotional impact of what they're trying to achieve. After I talk to the director, I set up a huge template of sample instruments so I know what colors I'm going to use. There's a lot of preparation before I write a single note, but if you do all that, it takes way less time to do a full film than you would imagine.How was it working on Furious â€“ The Legend of Kolovrat, since that's a big, action-packed period piece? It was a green-screen film, where they had the producer run the show, and a lot of the action was done in postproduction with digital animation. I was working with one of the producers named Dzhanik Fayziev, and we'd have conversations on Skype. We did live instrumentation, which made the music even more powerful.What did Dzhanik ask you for with this one? He kept on saying, ""More guitars, more guitars."" I was like, ""You don't have to say that twice. You want more guitars? I've been doing guitars for fucking 25 years. That's easy."" He wanted to push the envelope, and I liked that after scoring Intent to Destroy with Joe Berlinger. That film [Intent to Destroy] is this incredible documentary about genocide denial. It was so close to home, and with my grandparents being genocide survivors and spending my whole career talking about the need to be aware of the Armenian Genocide and how it connects with today, it was emotionally tough scoring that film. I put a lot of emotion into it, and Joe was extremely happy with how it made you feel everything that was going on. So after working on such a serious film, a film where you could just go fucking epic and over the top with Tuvan singing and more guitars was fun. It lightened it up. I imagine that's not you doing throat singing. No, it's not. I originally used samples and then we had an actual Tuvan singer overlay as a soloist on top of the sample and we mixed it together.What did you ask of the Tuvan singers? We sent them certain spot tracks and picked four or five spots and [asked them to] sing Tuvan in this key in whatever variation that you want in a long period of time and we'll cut it together. It added some live breath on top of the samples.You sang a song for the Furious soundtrack, ""A Fine Morning to Die,"" which is a duet with a Belarusian singer, Katya Ivanchikova. How did that come together? I'd done a cue and one of the producers said, ""No pressure, but if something pops up where you want to use it for end credits and happen to want to sing on it, we would be incredibly happy."" I was working on that theme in New Zealand, and I thought, ""Wow, there's something about this that requires a voice."" So I started singing on it and I used the words out of that exact scene from the English subtitles, and it made sense. They wanted me to sing in Russian, and I said, ""Absolutely not. I just don't know Russian."" You don't want to sing a language you're not confident in because then you're doing a disservice to that language and your performance. So I said, ""Let me sing in English,"" and we found this really amazing young Russian singer, Katya, and she did the vocals. We talked about it over the phone and she sent some comments back, and she nailed it. So it turned out to be the theme song.Let's talk about Intent to Destroy. How did you handle working on a project that was so close to you personally? You go through the emotions. There were times where I was sitting alone in the studio, scoring in the middle of the night fucking bawling my eyes out watching a scene while trying to write music for it. Joe is an amazing documentarian and he always includes the opposing opinion. He included a genocide denier in the film, and it's a horrific thing. Watching a genocide denier speaking in my studio, while I'm trying to score under them was really difficult. I told Joe I was throwing up in my mouth every day doing those scenes. It's not easy. As a composer, though, you shouldn't necessarily be emotionally connected to every film. I think you should understand it and bring out the emotions of the characters and the script. You shouldn't necessarily cry while you're doing it on every film, but when it does, it means it's a powerful film.You got some interesting sounds for Intent to Destroy. On ""Table Read"" and ""Hanging Village,"" there are some ghostlike effects. How did you get those? I used a lot of really cool, organic, arpeggiated, hybridized instruments on the bottoms of a lot of scenes to keep the bottom alive and moving and I would bring in solo instruments on top. With ""Table Read,"" there's a piano and a music box together playing arpeggiated and then there's strings that come on top that swell. I used that theme over and over again at different tempos, throughout the end because I found it very moving and beautiful. Every time it went back to the film, it became like the musical theme of [the Armenian Genocideâ€“themed movie] The Promise to me, but within Intent to Destroy. In The Promise, it comes in at the end as well when Christian Bale comes into the hotel and makes a big statement saying that they're killing men and banishing women and children into the desert. It's one of the most powerful statements from The Promise. I actually told Christian Bale, that statement makes the film. It's fucking 15 seconds, but it's so powerful. Since you mentioned The Promise, I wanted to tell you that when I interviewed Chris Cornell about his song for the film shortly before his death, he said he consulted you to make sure he got the tone right. What do you remember about that? We were both friends with [producer] Eric Esrailian, and we were both giving him advice on the music. He was asking for support. So Chris and I became closer as friends because of The Promise. At one point, I think they wanted us to do the main theme music together, and then they realized they were going to need two end tracks. So he did the title track, and I did this beautiful, classical-jazz rendition of an old Armenian folk song called ""Sari Siroun Yar."" But he sent me an email and he goes, ""What do you think?"" And I loved it. I told him, ""It's really emotional and you're bringing everything out."" He made a great connection in the song. The most important thing to realize about the Armenian Genocide is not just what happened 100 years ago, but how it's relevant today, because that shit's happening now. That's what he did with the song; he made that connection. I was really grateful for that.And I'm a huge fan of Soundgarden and Chris Cornell, growing up. And he knows that [laughs]. We became friends, but I've still always been his fan, you know? So his support on the film was incredibly important. It struck me when he and I talked that he wanted to think about the bigger picture. He was like that, man. He was very gracious with his emotions, his time. He was careful and conscientious. He did a great job in not just the music but supporting it, whether it's interviews or TV specials with the song and talking about it and the need to take care of survivors that are around today in Syria and around the world. Him and his wife Vicky have a charity, and I had the honor a few weeks back of giving Vicky, in Chris' name, a human rights award from Human Rights Watch at their yearly gala in Los Angeles. Matt Cameron and Kim Thayil were there. It was very special. It's very tough, man. I still can't get over [his death]. I can't get over how it happened. I still don't understand, and I don't think I ever will. And that's the truth.I wasn't even trying to go there.  I wasn't either, but I can't help it. I don't get it. Have you been working on much music other than composing? I have a bunch of rock songs I've been sitting on. I'm still trying to decide what to do with them [laughs]. Maybe I'll put out an EP or something. Having a young family, I really enjoy being home with my kid. When you put out a proper record with a band, you're doing videos and press and touring, and you're dedicating a few years to marketing your record. I'm at a point where that's not what I want to do. I'm happy to sit down have a few chats about a film score that I'm doing, because that's easy, but dedicating two years to one project like that is difficult. That's why I'm afraid of putting out my own record â€“ not afraid, but don't want to make that time dedication right now. So I might just put it out as an EP on iTunes and Spotify and do a few interviews and just let it be.It's not like you have to tour. You did a run with System of a Down this year, but you haven't done a solo run in a while. Oh, yeah, not since 2013. I've done orchestral shows, but not that many of those either since 2013. For years, I've been really focused on doing the scoring thing, and it's the next phase of my artistry. And of course I get shit for it, too. ""Hey, go make me a System record. What the hell are you doing with all of these scores?"" You're going to get all of that because people want what they want, but as an artist you've got to give them what comes to you. It's from a higher source somewhere [laughs].""Everyone's looking for headlines. I hate that.""Has System attempted to make an album at all? We have. We've discussed it and we've played each other songs, but we still haven't come eye to eye on how things should be done for us to be able to move forward with it. And that's where it's been. You all seem to be having fun touring though. That's the funny thing. When people don't see a record, they assume the worst about your internal relationship. But the truth is we're actually better friends â€“ at least I'm better friends with everyone than I've ever been. John's my brother-in-law; he's in my family. We have a great time together touring. But sometimes putting together a record, and that creative output and how things should be done, is different in four people's heads and it doesn't always come together. Fortunate or unfortunate, however you want to call it, that's the truth. But touring is easy, because you've done all these songs. You have fun, you go out and tour, and that's it.You must have gotten a real kick then out of the way the Internet picked up the ""Screw vocals"" story then, as if you were quitting System. Everyone's looking for headlines. I hate that. I hate when they take something and they just go with it. If you're going to print that, at least send us an email asking, ""Hey, did you say this?"" And I'd say, ""I probably did, but it was in this context."" At least check with me. Don't take an interview that was translated from Russian from five months ago on the set of a film without checking. Everyone's picking it up and going, ""Oh, my God, that means he's not doing System again?"" It's kind of funny. You want to negate all these things, but then you're like, ""Well, I didn't start it in the first place."" Why do I have to put out fires every two weeks? I've got shit to do. I'm working on music [laughs]. You're doing what they're reporting you're not doing. Yeah, exactly. I'm actually even doing vocals, funny enough. And you're writing your own music, too.Yeah. I was writing this one song a couple of months ago that is piano-based with orchestral strings, and I was like, ""Wow, I need to sing this because it requires vocals,"" and the words came to me in Armenian. I did it because it came to me; I don't even know where to place it but it's one of my favorite new songs I've written. Is it a System song? No. Is it a Serj Tankian solo song? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I'll put it at the end of a soundtrack somewhere. I write the music that comes to me. I don't predict what I'm going to do.For me as an artist, it also speaks to the need to not be repetitive. I started out doing music more as a lyricist and as a poet. I put out two poetry books, and I was mostly a lyricist when I started. I played some guitar and piano but I wasn't a phenomenal songwriter when I first started. Throughout the years I learned my trade, as we all do, and now I think I've gone there beyond songwriting and into composing.Do you still write poetry? I haven't in a while. For a while, I literally wrote every night. I had my notebook next to my bed and I would write. But for a number of years, I haven't. I can't explain it. The words are eluding me, I guess. I think at different times in life, you're excited about different things, but I've always wanted to write an interesting book so one day I will go back to the word. Part of it is also reading. When you read, you write more. I haven't been reading a lot because I've just been doing a lot of music so I haven't had a lot of time, and when you have a kid, you have less time for everything. By the way when I say, ""I don't read,"" I don't mean I don't read anything. I read a lot of news. I read a lot of current events. I just don't read as many books as I used to. And when you're writing, you should always be reading, because it replenishes your armory of words.I found my headline: ""Serj doesn't read!"" [Laughs] Yeah, exactly. You can do this, too. Everyone can do this. ""Serj doesn't do vocals and he doesn't read. What the fuck?"" [Laughs]Since you are as busy as you are, how do you split up your creative life and home life? What is an average day like for you? My priority is my family. Take this morning. I got up and was like, ""Phew, the fire hasn't hit us, thank God."" My wife had some stuff to do this morning, and my son was home from school because the air is pretty horrid outside. A lot of the schools are closed. So we played around and played outside on the trampoline and playhouse and sand and we did drawing and played with cars, building little garages out of blocks, and then my wife came. I went downstairs, did a little exercise then took a shower came to my first phone call then I'll be hitting the studio later tonight. It's a typical day. It's three or four hours of watching the kid. But if I had a career where I'd have to take off in the morning and I was just gonna see him for a few hours and then see my wife for a few hours, I don't want that. I didn't work this hard to do that. I worked this hard so I can create my own destiny and do what I wanna do and when I wanna do it. Everyone deserves that really. Fuck it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,Elias Leight,2017-11-29T19:21:00.000Z,What Will Billboard's New Streaming Rules Really Mean?,"billboard rules, streaming rules, billboard streaming rules, youtube billboard, spotify billboard, streams billboard, song streams, youtube streams",Rolling Stone,"Rap has dominated the Hot 100 this year. Five hip-hop tracks have taken the Number One spot, tying a chart record, and in April, rap singles singlehandedly accounted for half of the Top 10. It's also been a banner year for Latin pop â€“ Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's ""Despacito"" tied the record for the most weeks spent at Number One (16), and when J. Balvin and Willy William's ""Mi Gente"" flew to Number Three, it marked the first time ever that two non-English-language tracks held spots in the Top 10 simultaneously.But all this could change next year, due to a shift in the way Billboard plans to track its charts. The Hot 100 has three components â€“ sales, radio play and streaming â€“ and starting in 2018, Billboard will give more weight to streams from platforms that listeners pay for, discounting the impacts of YouTube, the largest music-streaming site in the world, and the free (or ad-supported) tier of Spotify. Paid streams will also count more on the Billboard 200, which tracks the most popular albums in the country each week.Billboard has not yet announced the size of the differential weighting, which will determine the extent to which these new rules impact songs that gain favor on free platforms. But the new system is likely to affect certain genres more than others: Nine of the 10 most viewed YouTube videos in the U.S. in the last 30 days were hip-hop or Latin pop records, and nine of the 10 most viewed artists on YouTube last month work predominantly in hip-hop, R&amp;B or Latin pop.&nbsp;For Jeff Vaughn â€“ who has worked with Kevin Gates, Young Thug and Kehlani as Vice President of A&amp;R at Artist Partners Group, a joint venture with Atlantic Records â€“ the question is not whether rap singles will have less impact on the charts; it's how drastic the drop will be. ""Five years ago, you never saw a rap record in the Top 40; this year you see them regularly in the Top 10, and not manufactured crossover records, but cultural songs,"" he says. ""I have to assume we will see less of that.""The decision to up-weight paid streams is just the latest in a series of changes to the charts that Billboard has initiated in the last five years as it attempts to grapple with an increasingly complicated task in the streaming era. (I also contribute to Billboard.) ""It's how you balance two sides of the equation: One side is recognizing the revenue for artists; the other side ends up being demand or popularity from the consumer point of view,"" says Ryan Redington, Director of Amazon Music, which has paid streaming that counts toward the Billboard charts. In the old days, the revenue side and the popularity side were effectively equivalent, because to hear a song, a listener either bought a CD or turned to easily monitored outlets like radio and MTV.That is no longer the case. ""How you measure the biggest has become very, very complicated,"" says Matthew Adell, former CEO of the online dance-music store Beatport. ""Do people spend money on it is one way. Do people spend time with it is another way."" As a result, there's a rift between the music industry, which wants to know what's keeping the lights on, and listeners, who want to know what's turning their friends on.&nbsp;Apple Music believes the charts should be revenue-focused. ""Billboard could have a free chart if they want,"" says Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine, ""but the chart that people argue for, that they strive to be Number One on, has to be a real chart."" Otherwise, he continues, ""they're mixing â€“ no pun intended â€“ apples and oranges.""&nbsp;Others aren't so sure. ""I'm a label guy, I get the need for money,"" Vaughn says. ""But at the same time, I just don't like the idea of people not being able to listen the music where they want to listen to the music, or if they choose to listen to it there, then it not being counted properly and reflecting the artist's popularity and the song's quality.""&nbsp;Billboard's attempts to satisfy both parties with a single metric began in 2012, when it incorporated streaming data into the Hot 100 for the first time. In 2013, the company also added YouTube to its Hot 100 accounting. The next year, streams began to count toward the album chart, with 1,500 streams from select services â€“ including Spotify and the Apple Music predecessor Beats Music, but not YouTube â€“ serving as the equivalent of a single album purchase.Each change to the accounting system has created some winners. Taylor Swift was a notable beneficiary of the initial decision to add streaming data to the charts; the inclusion of Pandora's numbers this past January helped Rihanna's single ""Sex With Me."" Less lucky were artists who perform well on radio but don't necessarily stream a lot, a group that includes many country artists and R&amp;B singers. But in general, these changes suggested a more inclusive pop world, and the Billboard charts better reflected the music the majority of listeners were actually spending time with â€“ even if, as is increasingly common, listeners were not spending money on that music.The latest rule change, if not entirely a step in the opposite direction, is more complicated, distorted by the music industry's dislike of free services and its ongoing feud with YouTube. YouTube helps create intercontinental hits and reaches a massive number of listeners&nbsp;â€“ the platform claims 1.5 billion logged-in users a month around the globe â€“ with an emphasis on the all-important young listeners, who dictate the direction of pop music. But the platform pays famously paltry royalties: A&nbsp;recent report from the Recording Industry Association of America suggested that Apple pays an artist between $12 and $15 per 1,000 streams, while Spotify pays roughly $7 and YouTube pays approximately $1. YouTube also relies on the shelter of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act to allow users to post content that they don't own the rights to.In addition, there is widespread concern in the music industry that some of the free streaming services can be manipulated in ways that artificially inflate a song's streams. ""SoundCloud and YouTube are a lot easier to game,"" says Nima Etminan, Vice President of Empire, a distribution company and record label that helped turn Fat Joe and Remy Ma's ""All the Way Up"" and XXXtentacion's ""Jocelyn Flores"" into hits.&nbsp;Matt Harmon, general manager of Beggars Group, which includes a number of independent, rock-focused labels, agrees. ""You don't have a very good view on what's happening [on YouTube],"" he explains. ""If at the end of the week, a number [of views] appears, how do you count it up? Is it a full song or not a full song? [The label Republic recently posted a video of Post Malone's ""Rockstar"" that only contained a loop of the chorus; the clip subsequently accumulated millions of views.] Who put it up? It's more than chaotic."" (It's worth noting here that other streaming services are not immune to manipulation: Since they have little transparency, they are often free to pick their own winners and losers, as long as they don't upset the major labels.)Iovine pushes Harmon's argument further. ""What you don't want is people leaning on a button that gets hundred of millions of streams and all of a sudden we're back to the old days, when you give somebody a shoulder bag, and they give you a Number One record,"" he says. ""A movie box office isn't based on how many people saw the trailer,"" Iovine adds. ""It's absurd. It's nonsensical.""&nbsp;In a statement, a YouTube spokeswoman noted, ""Billboard transformed the industry by recognizing YouTube is where music is discovered, hits are created and music pop culture is made. Unfortunately, with these changes, Billboard is essentially saying the only music fans that count are those with credit cards.""Iovine, in contrast, prefers to talk about musicians rather than listeners. ""Artists should be able to put their music wherever they want if it's in the interest of them and their partners,"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""But to be forced to put their music on certain platforms in order to get a better chart position is unfair and, dare I say, fake news. It only allows free services to take advantage of artists&nbsp;â€“ the lifeblood of what we do.""&nbsp;The impact of the new weighting system is hard to determine without knowing the size of the weight, and since Billboard does not make the consumption numbers that determine chart placement publicly available â€“ it only reveals the relative position of singles and albums â€“ attempts to calculate the new rules' effect are difficult. But it's easy to imagine that one particularly susceptible group of songs will be viral dance records like&nbsp;""Juju on That Beat"" by Zay Hilfigerrr and Zayion McCall, an act that Vaughn signed to Atlantic Records before the song went to Number Five on the Hot 100. ""Juju on That Beat"" was being streamed roughly 20 million times a week when it climbed into the Top 10, and Vaughn estimates that approximately 80 percent of those streams came from YouTube. Under the new regime, the chart position of a song that has a lower ratio of paid to unpaid streams will suffer relative to a single with a higher ratio, all else equal.&nbsp;At Rolling Stone's request, Amir Kashani, Head of Strategy at LVRN â€“ a creative agency and label that has D.R.A.M., 6lack and Raury on its roster â€“ and Dan Feldstein, who co-founded the media consulting company Salt + Vinegar with Kashani, performed an estimate of the impact that Billboard's new rules would have on D.R.A.M.'s ""Broccoli,"" a streaming-heavy Top 10 crossover hit from 2016, using a few hypothetical weights. ""When 'Broccoli' was peaking, 64 percent of streams came from ad-supported channels, especially YouTube,"" Kashani says. ""If ad-supported streams counted less than paid streams, that could have negatively impacted 'Broccoli''s chart position.""Justin ""Meezy"" Williams, whose company Meezy Entertainment manages the rapper 21 Savage (who has racked up 37.8 million views on his ""Bank Account"" in the past month alone), suggests that the new rules are part of a backlash against hip-hop's chart success. ""Right now, if it's not us [scoring hits], it's Cardi B; it's Rae Sremmurd; it's Migos,"" he says. ""We run the whole thing. They don't like this shit."" A major label official disputes that characterization, contending that rappers and R&amp;B singers still stand to benefit from the new rules, since their streaming audiences continue to grow rapidly.In a statement announcing its rule changes, Billboard said that it also considered including YouTube streams in album standings for the first time, ultimately deciding against it. As a result, shifts on the Billboard 200 may be less jarring, because without counting YouTube, every act's ratio of paid to unpaid streams goes up.&nbsp;But some artists are still likely to see their stock improve on the albums chart under the new rules. Harmon of Beggars Group expects that his roster's impact will be magnified. ""We don't typically have artists that compete on the singles chart; we tend to perform better on the premium services,"" he says. ""I think that we will benefit from premium plays being weighted heavier.""Two of the biggest winners aren't artists at all: Apple Music and Amazon Music lag behind YouTube and Spotify in terms of users, but they do not have a free tier, so all their streams are now worth more. ""If they're decreasing the impact of Spotify and the impact of YouTube, that means by default the other players matter more in the ecosystem and will be more competitive,"" says Feldstein.&nbsp;Does chart placement matter?&nbsp;Is it just a snapshot of consumption â€“ with a bias, in 2018, towards revenue-maximizing consumption â€“ at any given moment without wider-reaching consequences? Or does it feed back into the music ecosystem, affecting artists' livelihood and the musical horizons of millions of casual listeners?It seems fair to expect that a rule change like this will have consequences that ripple beyond the charts, even if a listener isn't consulting the Hot 100 every week to determine what to stream. ""If you're going to be looking at the effects of any type of correction, you must look at it holistically,"" says Kashani. ""We look at streaming numbers as more than just revenue; we look at that as marketing.""Buzz from streaming also helps songs gain momentum on tour and on radio; it's not clear how lower chart placement might lessen those effects. ""Distribution strategies and marketing strategies will be affected by these corrections,"" Kashani adds. And if the relative clout of Apple Music and Amazon Music increases, that will surely have repercussions as well. ""When every music platform is chasing relationships with talent, this might change some of those conversations,"" Feldstein notes.From the consumers' perspective, the danger of the new chart rules is that instead of measuring listening, they measure different kinds of listeners and discount the preferences of some of them: The listenership on YouTube, for example, skews towards younger listeners. ""I'm not that worried about that,"" counters Apple Music's Robert Kondrk. ""If you go look at Apple Music and look at our charts, I think it screams usage by young kids.""&nbsp;""To think that a chart is going to affect a customer, except if you're Number One, is pretty naive,"" Iovine adds. ""How many millennials do you think read Billboard? That's a specious argument.""&nbsp;In one sense he's right: Both artists and listeners will almost certainly continue to use free streaming services. ""[YouTube]'s the best way to reach young fans,""&nbsp;Vaughn of Artists Partners Group  says. ""As we moved from Twitter to Instagram to Stories, which is all video, it feels like YouTube is perfectly positioned, and that video will be more important than ever.""Similarly, when asked how the change in chart accounting will impact his job, Williams, offers the verbal equivalent of a shrug. ""It ain't gonna stop nothing on our end,"" he says. ""At the end of the day, if you're hot, you're hot.""But will the new Hot 100 and Billboard 200 reflect that heat?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,Dan Epstein,2018-01-30T14:55:24.340Z,The Velvet Underground's 'White Light/White Heat': 10 Things You Didn't Know,"velvet underground, velvet underground white light white heat, white light white heat",Rolling Stone,"Of all of the Velvet Underground's officially released studio and live albums, White Light/White Heat is by far the noisiest and most difficult. ""No one listened to it,"" said Lou Reed of the LP in 2013, just a few months before his death. ""But there it is forever â€“ the quintessence of articulated punk. And no one goes near it.""Recorded in a short flurry of studio sessions in September 1967, and released on January 30th, 1968, White Light/White Heat&nbsp;â€“ the band's final studio album with co-founder and multi-instrumentalist John Cale â€“ boasted none of the louche charm of the Velvets' 1967 debut, The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico; nor, for that matter, did it contain any of the hushed melodicism heard on the band's self-titled 1969 LP, and it was utterly devoid of any instant classic-rock anthems like ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock and Roll"" from 1970's Loaded. With its needle-pinning assault of overdriven instruments, and lyrics about methamphetamine abuse (the title track), botched medical procedures (""Lady Godiva's Operation""), grisly violence (""The Gift""), cries from beyond the grave (""I Heard Her Call My Name"") and heroin-dealing drag queens (""Sister Ray""), White Light/White Heat was all about pushing the boundaries of sound and taste. Even 50 years after its initial release, it remains a bracing and challenging listen. ""It's a very rabid record,"" Cale opined in the liner notes to the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See. ""The first one had some gentility, some beauty. The second one was consciously anti-beauty.""But contrary to Reed's assertion, some people certainly have listened to it. Even though the record only briefly appeared on the Billboard 200, peaking at Number 199 in March 1968, and was largely ignored by the music press, White Light/White Heat would prove profoundly influential upon such artists as the Stooges, David Bowie, Jonathan Richman, Suicide, the Buzzcocks and a little band called Nirvana, to name a few â€“ and in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked&nbsp;White Light/White Heat at Number 293 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album has also gained new fans over the years via various reissues, and will surely make some additional converts via its inclusion in Verve Records/UMe's forthcoming 180-gram vinyl box set, The Velvet Underground, which drops February 23rd and will contain ""definitive stereo editions"" of the band's four studio albums, as well as Nico's 1967 album Chelsea Girl, and a two-LP recreation of the band's much-mythologized ""lost"" album from 1969.In honor of the album's 50th anniversary, here are 10 things you probably didn't know about White Light/White Heat.1. The album's ugly and aggressive sound was an intentional reaction against the flower-power vibe of the ""Summer of Love"".When the Velvet Underground entered New York's Mayfair Sound Studios to begin work on the album in September 1967, the vaunted ""Summer of Love"" was still grooving in San Francisco â€“ and blissed-out hippie scenes were something the Velvets wanted absolutely no part of. ""Inspired by media hype, and encouraged by deceitful songs on the radio (Airplane, Mamas and Papas, Eric Burdon), teenage ninnies flocked from Middle-America out to the coast,"" Velvets guitarist Sterling Morrison remembered in Victor Bockris and Gerard Malanga's&nbsp;Uptight: The Velvet Underground Story. ""And so, at the height of the 'Summer of Love,' we stayed in NYC and recorded White Light/White Heat, an orgasm of our own.""&nbsp;""It was very funny â€“ until there were a lot of casualties,"" said Lou Reed of the hippie movement in a 1987 Rolling Stone interview. ""Then it wasn't funny anymore. I don't think a lot of people realized at the time what they were playing with. That flower-power thing eventually crumbled as a result of drug casualties and the fact that it was a nice idea but not a very realistic one. What we, the Velvets, were talking about, though it seemed like a down, was just a realistic portrayal of certain kinds of things.""2. The album's fuzzed-out guitar sounds were the direct result of the band's endorsement deal with Vox, the British musical-equipment manufacturer.Initially popularized in America by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and other British Invasion acts who used their amplifiers, organs and guitars, England's Vox company struck an endorsement deal with the Velvet Underground in 1966, making Reed &amp; Co. one of (if not the) first American bands to endorse their gear. The powerful Vox amps and fuzz pedals enabled the band to experiment with volume and distortion, which they pushed to the fullest extent on White Light/White Heat. ""Those guys used Vox amps and Vox fuzz boxes for the first two albums,"" Velvets obsessive Jonathan Richman explained to Bockris and Malanga. ""On stuff like 'Sister Ray' and 'The Gift,' the fuzz is important. Vox fuzz bozes are distinct from other fuzz sounds. Lou used to use the built-in mid-range boost peculiar to Vox amplifiers a lot."" ""White Light/White Heat was just us using the Vox amps and playing them emphatically,"" added Morrison, with some degree of understatement.3. Though generally thought to be about methamphetamine, ""White Light/White Heat"" may also have been partly inspired by Lou Reed's interest in metaphysics.Given Lou Reed and John Cale's well-known affection for methamphetamine use during the Velvets' early years, the album's title track has long been interpreted as nothing more than an enthusiastic ode to shooting speed. But according to Richie Unterberger's White Light/White Heat: The Velvet Underground Day by Day, Reed hinted in a November 1969 radio interview that the song may have also had something to do with his lesser-known interest in metaphysical studies. ""I've been involved and interested in what they call 'white light' for a long time,"" he told an interviewer at KVAN in Portland, Oregon, noting his recent investigation of a Japanese form of healing ""that's a way of giving off white light."" In the same interview, he also cited Alice Bailey's A Treatise on White Magic&nbsp;â€“ which includes instructions on how to ""call down a stream of pure White Light"" â€“ calling it ""an incredible book.""4. Lou Reed ""played"" a cantaloupe on the album, at the urging of Frank Zappa.On the track ""The Gift,"" John Cale reads a short story, written by Reed, about a lovesick young man named Waldo Jeffers, who tries to surprise his girlfriend by mailing himself to her in a large cardboard box, but meets a grisly end when her unsuspecting friend uses a sheet-metal cutter to open the package. ""I wrote 'The Gift' while I was at college,' Reed told Lester Bangs in a May 1971 Creem interview. ""I used to write lots of short stories, especially humorous pieces like that. So. one night Cale and I were sitting around and he said, 'Let's put one of those stories to music.'""In order to achieve the sound of a blade plunging through Jeffers' skull, Reed (depending on who's telling the story) either stabbed a cantaloupe with a knife, or smashed it with a wrench â€“ directed by none other than Frank Zappa, who was recording with the Mothers of Invention at the same studio. ""He said, 'You'll get a better sound if you do it this way,'"" Reed later recalled to Mojo. ""And then he says, 'You know, I'm really surprised by how much I like your album.'""5. ""Here She Comes Now"" was originally written to be sung by Nico.A sequel to Lou Reed's mysterious character study ""Femme Fatale,"" ""Here She Comes Now"" was originally intended as a vehicle for Nico, the German chanteuse who â€“ at the suggestion of then-manager Andy Warhol â€“ had sung ""Femme Fatale,"" ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" on the Velvet Underground's first album. She reportedly sang ""Here She Comes Now"" at a few live performances, as well; and while there's no recorded version of the song with her on vocals, it's easy to imagine her Teutonic tones icily caressing lines like ""She looks so good/But she's made out of wood."" But after the band parted ways with both Warhol and Nico in the spring of 1967, it fell to Lou Reed to record the vocals of the song for White Light/White Heat.6. Lou Reed's guitar solo on ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" was a tribute to jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman.Throughout his career, Reed often spoke about his love of free jazz, and specifically the music of saxophonist Ornette Coleman. ""There were two sides of the coin for me,"" he told Rolling Stone's David Fricke in 1989. ""R&amp;B, doo-wop, rockabilly. And then Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry, Archie Shepp, stuff like that. When I was in college, I had a jazz radio show. I called it Excursion on a Wobbly Rail, after a Cecil Taylor song. I used to run around the Village following Ornette Coleman wherever he played.""Reed's free jazz influence is apparent on several of White Light/White Heat's tracks â€“ especially on the vicious, mind-splitting guitar solo in ""I Heard Her Call My Name,"" which found him cranking up his amp and channeling his inner Coleman. ""I wanted to play like that,"" Reed told Fricke. ""I used the distortion to connect the notes, so you didn't hear me hesitating and thinking. ... I never thought of it as violent. I thought it was amazing fun.""7. A studio engineer was so put off by ""Sister Ray"" that he actually left the studio while it was being recorded.Clocking in at 17-and-a-half minutes on record â€“ and often much longer in concert â€“ the tawdry epic ""Sister Ray"" was one of Andy Warhol's favorite songs from the Velvet Underground's live sets. ""When we were making the second record,"" Lou Reed told Rolling Stone in 1989, ""He said, 'Now you gotta make sure that you do the 'sucking on my ding-dong' song.' 'Okay, Andy.' He was a lot of fun, he really was.""However, one of the engineers working on White Light/White Heat â€“&nbsp;either Gary Kellgren or Val Valentine, both of whom worked on the record in an engineering capacity â€“ was far less amused when the band was recording the improvisatory track in the studio. In Anthony DeCurtis' Lou Reed: A Life, Reed recounts that, ""When we recorded 'Sister Ray,' the engineer stood up and said, 'Listen, I'm leaving. You can't pay me enough to listen to this crap. I'll be down in the commissary getting coffee. When you're done, hit that button and come get me.' That's completely true.""8. Producer Tom Wilson spent more time chasing women than actually overseeing the album.Though White Light/White Heat producer Tom Wilson â€“ who had also helmed albums by Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, and the Mothers of Invention â€“ had previously worked with the Velvets on The Velvet Underground and Nico, the band wasn't always thrilled with his involvement (or lack thereof) during the sessions for White Light/White Heat. ""He knew more, uh, ladies of the night than there are women on this planet,"" John Cale recalled to Creem in 1987. ""He's a swinger par excellence. It was unbelievable, a constant parade into that studio. He was inspired, though, and used to joke around to keep everybody in the band light.""Velvets drummer Moe Tucker was particularly incensed when Wilson became too distracted by what she described as ""the blondes running through the studio"" to remember to turn up the microphones on her drums during a specific break in ""Sister Ray."" ""I could have killed myself,"" she later complained to the Velvet Underground fanzine What Goes On. ""'Cause we did two takes of that as I recall, and it came out nice, it was really good, and here's this part that drops out the bottom. I was tapping on the rim, and it wasn't recorded. And of course everybody thinks that I stopped playing the drums, which infuriates me.""9. The album's cover art was a ""parting gift"" from Andy Warhol.When the Velvets and Andy Warhol parted ways shortly after the release of The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico, the split wasn't exactly an amicable one. ""He sat down and had a talk with me,"" Lou Reed told Rolling Stone in 1989. ""[He said] 'You gotta decide what you want to do. Do you want to keep just playing museums from now on and the art festivals? Or do you want to start moving into other areas? Lou, don't you think you should think about it?' So I thought about it, and I fired him. Because I thought that was one of the things to do if we were going to move away from that. He was furious. I'd never seen Andy angry, but I did that day. He was really mad. Called me a rat. That was the worst thing he could think of.""But by the end of 1967, Warhol's anger had subsided enough for him to suggest an idea for the design of White Light/White Heat's album cover. According to a December 1967 letter from Lou Reed to Gerard Malanga, it was Warhol's idea to use ""a black-on-black picture of a motorcyclist tattoo by Billy [Name]. Beautiful. ALL BLACK!"" Reed had seen the tattoo in question on the bicep of actor Joe Spencer in Warhol's film Bike Boy; and with Warhol's permission, Factory artist Billy Name blew up a black-and-white negative frame from the film and set it against a black background, creating a cover that was the very antithesis of the psychedelic, Sgt. Pepperâ€“inspired imagery that was everywhere at the time.10. ""White Light/White Heat"" and ""Here She Comes Now"" were banned in several radio markets because of their content.Though the songs ""White Light/White Heat"" and ""Here She Comes Now"" sounded like nothing else on the American airwaves in late 1967, Verve, the band's label, decided to release the songs â€“ the two shortest cuts on White Light/White Heat&nbsp;â€“ to radio on a seven-inch single. Unsurprisingly, the single stiffed, and so few were even pressed that original copies now change hands for hundreds of dollars.But while the songs had little commercial appeal to begin with, members of the band would claim on several occasions that they had actually been banned â€“ the raging ""White Light/White Heat"" because of its drug references, and the quieter ""Here She Comes Now"" due to what some programmers perceived as sexual content. ""We put out 'Here She Comes Now' in San Francisco and they said, 'That's about a girl coming,'"" Reed recalled to Time Out in 1972. ""And I said, 'Well no, it's not, it's about somebody coming into a room.' And then I listened to the record and I realized it probably was about a girl coming as a matter of fact, but then again, so what? But we were banned again.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,Andy Greene,2017-11-06T16:42:00.000Z,"The Last Word: Billy Gibbons on Cars, Marriage, Touring With Jimi Hendrix","zz top, billy gibbons, zz top interview, zz top rolling stone, billy gibbons interview, billy gibbons beard, billy gibbons jimi hendrix",Rolling Stone,"ZZ Top frontman Billy Gibbons was experiencing a rare bit of downtime when he phoned into Rolling Stone for a Last Word interview in late October. ZZ Top had just postponed their remaining 2017 dates while bassist Dusty Hill dealt with what a press released called a ""tummy ailment,"" and Gibbons had yet to begin his current solo tour. That gave him plenty of time to reflect on his long life and share some wisdom as he barreled down the highway on his way to a recording session in Nashville. ""This was an unexpected treat,"" he said at the end of the hour-long conversation. ""Thank you for giving me something to think about on this ride.""What's the best advice you ever received?B.B. King laid quite a simplistic statement on me: Learn to play what you want to hear. When you're trying to learn an instrument, chances are you find yourself at the feet of a teacher who may have an idea of what you should learn. But if you learn to play what you want to hear in your head, you are steps ahead.What do you do to relax?I have had the good fortune to be invited into the secret world of Jimmy Shine, a California hot-rodder who really knows which way is up. He lets me tiptoe into the garage and pick up a wrench and a torch once in a while.What's your favorite city in the world?Las Vegas. One of my favorite houses is located there. I'm on musicians' hours, and Vegas rolls 24/7. Also, everything is square, nothing is round in Las Vegas. When you live this kind of uncertain life from being on the road, you don't like sitting in chairs with a round arm. You like sitting in a nice square chair because it has identifiable corners.Do you gamble?Oh, yeah. We throw them bones. We like to step up to the craps table and look for that 7/11.â€¨What was your favorite book as a child, and what does it say about you?Junior's Fun to Draw. I think it was originally published in 1944, and if you're lucky, you can find one on eBay. That book taught the left hand to watch the right hand. It teaches you how to draw page by page. It starts out with circles and squares and ovals, and then you put them together. Very informative.What's your favorite book of all time?It's a surreal book by Haruki Murakami called Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. I find myself rereading it every couple of years. Definitely a bit on the creepy side. It's effective in dragging you out of incessant thinking, because the creative mind, it will not leave you alone. There's a great saying: ""For the artistically inclined, just remember you don't have to swing at every pitch.""What's your favorite movie of all time?The Passenger with Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider. I am a big fan of Michelangelo Antonioni, the director, and this is one of those disturbingly quiet type films, but it is really thought-provoking. It's very soothing and it was shot in the deserts of North Africa. It has all these elements of intrigue that has the quiet feeling.What's the most indulgent purchase you've ever made?I bought a Cadillac Eldorado convertible with my first royalty check. Triple white. This fascination with cars, old, new and everything in between, started with that really indulgent purchase.â€¨Gene Simmons says rock is dead. Do you think it is?Maybe in his head. In my head it's still quite a robust way to express yourself. You can really let go of the stress, which is really healthy.â€¨Do you like hip-hop?I quite like it. That's a great thing about growing up and hanging out in Houston. The hip-hop and rock scene was something that we really enjoyed. We would run into the hip-hop guys at Digital Services Recording. They wanted to know how to play the guitar, and all us rock guys wanted to know how to create those crazy backbeats. It was a nice exchange.You toured with Jimi Hendrix when you were young. What did you learn from him?He was a real technical wizard. He was inventing things to do with the Stratocaster guitar I am confident the designers had no clue would unfold in later years. Jimi had the talent to make that work for him. His technique was very peculiar in that he was playing a right-handed guitar in a left-handed style, upside down. To look at it and try to figure out what he was doing was very daunting. But we got to share opposing hotel rooms always at the end of the hall and the doors were always open. He had a record player delivered each and every afternoon, and he would motion to me, ""Come on over here. Lets see if we can figure this out."" And we wound up listening to Jeff Beck trying to figure things out. I said, ""Jimi, chances are that Jeff Beck is sitting there listening to you saying the same thing. 'How do we do this?'""Everyone always talks about the negative aspects of the collapse of the recording industry. What are the positive aspects?It's now up to the individual to invent the kind of business offer that he thinks will work. You no longer are you slave labor to someone elseâ€™s wishes. I think it's a glorious awakening to know you have the opportunity to step up and control your destiny.Do you think if ZZ Top started today you guys would still make it?If we embraced that same youthful enthusiasm that brought us together in the first place, it might just might well work. We threw caution to the wind and jumped into it with both feet, but all we wanted was to make loud noises, get free beer and chase the girls after the show.You didn't get married until 2005. Why did you wait so long?I could have gone down the aisle a number of times, but I came to the conclusion that this life is too short and you got to do everything you can while you can. I finally said, ""OK, let's try it out."" It's been a splendid thing.How would you rate Trump as a president?It's a hard job to fulfill. You got to let the guy who holds that place do the best they can. And it's a topsy-turvry position. It's very challenging no matter who is in the chair. But I don't mind the guy. I mean, I have never been politically motivated one direction or the other. I am glad I don't have to do it as I said it's a challenge that really quite a great bit of fortitude and stamina. We will see. Frankly I don't care. Just make sure we keep this country in a forward direction.Do you have any thoughts on gun control in the wake of Las Vegas?That was a tragic example of just some total insanity. It's very difficult to predict, I don't know if it's so much control of guns as it might be control of idiots. It's a challenging topic that really demands some insightfulness. Can we learn from an event like that unfolding? I don't know anything more than I think we should remain vigilant and carry on and enjoy the world. We are really not sure who controlling the design over all of this thing we call life.&nbsp;Have you ever been tempted to shave your beard?Years ago, we were approached with a rather sizable sum to take a razor to the chin whiskers. We thought about it for a second. But we're not sure what's exactly under here, so we perhaps wisely passed. What was once a very peculiar physical appearance seems to have become a trend, which makes it a little more easy to walk down the street. In the past, we were taken for either an escapee from a Western movie or some kind of religious nut.You drink beer through a straw to avoid getting suds in your beard. What else does the beard force you to do?The one constant question is, ""Is the beard under the covers or over the covers?"" I guess that depends on the weather. If you take to sporting famous chin whiskers, keep in mind it goes where you go. It's always important to keep your eye on the grooming shelf, make sure you bring along plenty of conditioner.I've read that you sleep on the floor of hotel rooms rather than the bed. What's up with that? These days, they make these mattresses so soft and squishy, and it can be a bit unnerving if you are looking for something trustable. Throwing a pallet on the floor for me is just that. I make sure to make friends with housekeeping. They find it unusual that I ask for half a dozen extra comforters and half a dozen extra pillows and a blanket on top. How does your wife feel about this?Shefinally gave up. I mean, she will come down to what I call the picnic zone. Andshe says, ""Oh, it's sleepy-sleepy time. I have to get the biscuit.""So we got a good thing going on. If she needs a little attention, a littleloving, I will crawl up and snuggle up. Gotta do that.&nbsp;To wrap up, do you still want to be in ZZ Top at age 80?Well, yeah, I could do it. We are smack dab in the middle of a technological breakthrough that is making life extension quite a bit of the day-to-day norm. I read a prediction the real fireworks get underway about the 366 day cycle starting in the year 2024, in which 10-to-the-75-power seconds at the conclusion of that cycle will reveal scientific breakthroughs comparable to the creation of language or the experience of life itself. And then the last 10-to-the-75-power seconds of those seconds will reveal all that is knowable, but is unknown. That is quite a mouthful. It's only seven years away, so let's go for it.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,Brian Hiatt,2017-11-07T17:58:00.000Z,"Diplo on Ripoffs, Why Streaming Hurts Taylor Swift and Being a 'Poseur'","diplo, taylor swift, post malone, cardi b, mark ronson, diplo new album, diplo quotes, diplo on taylor swift, diplo songs, diplo records",Rolling Stone,"Everything else keeps changing â€“ EDM sinks, young rappers rise, rock legends die â€“ but there's one apparent constant in music this decade: Diplo just keeps getting more famous. An unexpectedly moving new documentary, the Apple Music exclusive Give Me Future (out November 17th), showcases a history-making 2016 show that his group Major Lazer played in Cuba; Viceland's What Would Diplo Do? offers a fictionalized, comical version of the DJ-producer, played by former Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek. And the actual Diplo keeps making interesting, future-shaping music, from the trap-and-highlife-influenced recent Major Lazer EP, Know No Better, to his pop EP with singer-songwriter Starrah. And while he's not the most sentimental of humans, he'll never forget that Cuba show, the first by a U.S. act in more than a decade. ""We had a moment where those kids felt like they were part of a global music culture,"" he says. The manipulated vocal sound you and Skrillex created for Justin Bieber's ""Where R Ãœ Now"" ended up on a million songs afterward. Did you feel ripped off?You can't be mad â€“ you just kind of gotta go with the flow. Music does whatever it wants. It's like getting mad at, like, a wave. Hopefully people know the history, that we were one of the catalysts for so many sounds. But as time goes by, it gets less apparent who did what. So you just kind of gotta stay ahead of the curve. And with Justin, we were just trying to be as punk as we could in the lane of EDM.â€¨Drake has an approach similar to yours in some ways â€“ he finds new sounds and artists and quickly incorporates them into his music. What's it like to see a huge star employ your methods?Drake is a huge songwriter and a cultural engineer. Drake was the first guy to jump on a song with Migos. He was the first guy to put [Nigerian artist] Wizkid on a mainstream record. He sees trends, and he gets ahead of them. I think I'm the same way. Do you fear getting to the point where you hear new sounds and just don't understand them?There are some young rappers that I kind of go, ""Jeez"" â€“ until I see them live. Rap music is a very youthful scene right now. It's not made for people like me: white men, 30-plus years old. How has streaming changed what becomes a hit and what doesn't?Music is in the hands of the kids. Streaming is literally what kids want to listen to over and over again. They want to listen to [Post Malone's] ""Rockstar"" and [Cardi B's] ""Bodak Yellow"" â€“ they don't want to listen to, like, [Taylor Swift's] ""Look What You Made Me Do."" That music doesn't relate to them at all. I don't think it ever did. They were only given that, by radio and marketing budgets. I'm impressed with Post Malone. I can relate to him more than Taylor Swift.Does the goofy fictional version of you on TV make you self-conscious?It hurt to watch it the first time. It made my stomach twist. I think that James plays a really funny Diplo. He's doing his best, but he's just an idiot. I don't mind being ridiculed. People relate to dance music, but you can't relate to a Zac Efron DJ movie, right?On the show, Diplo asks, ""Are we just poseurs pushing buttons?"" Is that a question you ask yourself?I know I'm a poseur pushing buttons onstage! You can't really deliver a lot as a DJ in concert. There's not much you can do. Your job as a producer is to make enough great material that people will show up to see the music you've made. It's the same reason you show up at a Rolling Stones concert: to hear the hits. You said that you and Mark Ronson are working on a ""disco"" album together. What's going on with that?I met Mark as a DJ in New York probably 12 years ago. I was more of the underground version of him, in a way. We always said, ""We should do something together one day."" Now we have some ideas. We just want to go on tour and do a little DJ'ing together. You've said that you want to get off the road and just be a songwriter and producer. Wouldn't you miss it?The thing about shows is the money is immediate. With songwriting, you might write 10 songs and they're all B sides. Or you might make a song that gets picked up by BeyoncÃ© as a single. If I do a show, I get paid this month. Your Twitter used to be really wild, but now you've toned down. Why?Everyonce in a while, I might be political, and I just get millions of peopleattacking me. I don't really feel like being a catalyst for arguments on theInternet, whether it's politics or whatever. Sarcasm doesn't travel well overthe Internet â€“ especially being a white dude on the Internet. I don't have anypass to say anything sarcastic or funny.

46,Elias Leight,2018-01-09T16:26:08.875Z,"Justin Timberlake Producer Danja Talks Making the Wild, Futuristic 'Filthy'","Justin Timberlake, Justin Timberlake Filthy, Justin Timberlake Man of the Woods, Justin Timberlake new album, Danja, Timbaland",Rolling Stone,"Last Friday, pop superstar Justin Timberlake returned with ""Filthy,"" a strutting single that's a surprising pivot from the carefree, innocuous Trolls tune ""Can't Stop the Feeling!"" In contrast, ""Filthy"" is full of grating synths and shrill screams. There's a pair of stadium-funk breakdowns, all walloping drum fills and histrionic guitars. Although Timberlake has relied heavily on falsetto vocal displays in the past, this time he keeps his voice in the middle of mix, so the singer and the music are equal partners. The singer co-produced the track with Timbaland and Danja, the same two beatmakers who oversaw his 2006 tour de force, FutureSex/LoveSounds. Danja spoke with Rolling Stone about the sessions for Timberlake's upcoming Man of the Woods&nbsp;and the process behind ""Filthy.""Were there a lot of conversations about where you wanted this record to go?There wasn't much talk, wasn't much game-planning, wasn't a big huddle. By the time I got there, he already had a direction. It was just me falling into what he already had in motion.In the trailer for the album, he talks a lot about the album reflecting his Tennessee roots. Is that something you noticed in the session?I did â€“ mostly from him, his energy, how he looked. He wasn't in the studio trying to be dressed up in suits, pretty-boy Justin. He was rugged like how the trailer looks. That was the energy.Did you feel that was a different energy compared to the FutureSex/LoveSounds sessions?Definitely. But it all comes from him. â€_ Obviously he's in a way different place in his life than where he was at that time. It's only right that the music reflects that.Who was in the studio with you during the sessions for the new record?It was inspiring because you had myself and Timbaland in one room, you had Chad [Hugo] and Pharrell [of the Neptunes] in another room, you had Rob Knox and Eric Hudson in another room. You have all these duos of great producers around, and obviously for me, I'm a competitive person â€“  it's going to create a competitive spirit. If I know they're in there working, I'm gonna make sure that we're over here doing the most phenomenal thing that we can come up with. Justin was bouncing around from room to room writing and recording and vibing with everybody.How did ""Filthy"" start?Me and Timbaland had a groove going. Justin poked his head in and he was like, ""What's that?"" He would rock a little bit; you could tell he was writing a little bit. Then he would go to another room and work on other stuff. That's the way he works â€“ he's always working even when he looks like he's not, always writing even when he looks like he's not. Then he'll come into the booth and blurt the whole song out without you even knowing he had it.Did you have both the grating electronic part and the live-sounding bassline from the beginning?A lot of times I just throw sounds together to see what works. I knew I wanted a very strong groove, and a lot of that comes with the bassline, and immediately I wanted the groove to lock â€“ once the beat drops, I want that groove to lock you in. The [sings electronic-sounding part] was designed to move a certain way. The live bassline on top of it gives a different layer of something familiar. You can't run away from that bassline. That makes you walk a certain way, talk a certain way. And that's kind of what it did â€“ the bassline helped make [Justin] come who he became on ""Filthy.""And you added screams to the beat?I wanted things to grab your attention: little screams, moans, breathing, you hear a lion on the second verse. He says something about ""the cage"" and you hear a lion roar and a cage close. I wanted things to grab your attention from all different angles, make you feel some type of way, and not give you a break.The breakdowns in there with screaming guitars and drum fills are almost out of a Mint Condition song.The breakdown was all [Timberlake]. He came back in the room after having laid a verse or something. He was like, ""Can you start the track like this?"" And he sang a melody along with doing a body movement. I watched that, looked at how he was moving, heard the melody and started working on that intro and making it as big as possible. He's pretty much a producer. He's very involved in the orchestration of the music. And that definitely was his idea.Right now everything on radio is full of hi-hats â€“ you didn't feel like you had to put some on this record?Number One, there's enough of that going on already. Number Two, the track didn't call for that. Even if I tried to do it â€“ I'm not gonna say I didn't attempt it â€“ it doesn't feel right. It dates it, puts it into a place of what's happening right now. That's not where you want to be.You have a few other songs on the album in addition to ""Filthy?""I did a record called ""Say Something"" and a record called ""Sauce.""""Say Something"" is the record with Chris Stapleton?I believe so.He's a country singer. Is that a different lane for you?I've been known to be versatile. I'm a musician; I can play and fit anywhere. But I wouldn't say that's a country record.&nbsp;This is the first time since Justified that Timberlake has really worked with multiple distinct production units on an album. How does your stuff blend with the Neptunes stuff and Eric Hudson and Rob Knox's?You've got the common thread, which is Justin. He's gonna make it all blend even if the music sounds different. We all played a role in the world that he was creating. You're not gonna come to us to get the same thing that Pharrell's gonna do. And you're not gonna go to Pharrell to get what we do. We do what we do, and he ties it all in.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,Brian Hiatt,2018-02-01T15:10:57.979Z,"David Byrne on Trump, Cultural Appropriation and Why He Won't Reunite Talking Heads","david byrne, talking heads",Rolling Stone,"""My booking agent said, 'I think you're having a Leonard Cohen moment,'â€‰"" says David Byrne â€“ before hastening to clarify, with a laugh, that the reference was to renewed relevance and popularity, not his impending demise. In March, he's releasing a strong new album, American Utopia (written over tracks created by his longtime collaborator Brian Eno), before heading out on the most elaborate tour he's attempted since the Talking Heads shows captured in 1984's Stop Making Sense â€“ with a career-spanning set list that will include updated versions of his Eighties work. ""We have six drummers and percussionists,"" says Byrne, 65, who envisions a stage full of musicians in constant, choreographed motion, expanding a concept he and St. Vincent used for the horn section on their joint 2012 tour. ""The human beings become the set."" Your album, like a lot of your recent work, is pretty tight and poppy. How deliberate was that direction?I'm comfortable with that partly because the lyrics are so very, very far away from what you would hear in a normal pop song. I mean, with a lot of artists I just go, ""You've gotta write about something other than your boyfriend and your girlfriend! The world is a big place. You're not 18 anymore â€“ you can do this!"" [Laughs]You just did a Reasons to Be Cheerful multimedia project, where you found reasons to be optimistic about the world. But what makes you pessimistic?The fact that the Republican Party hasn't broken rank with Donald Trump. He's a fucking racist, and they're going along with it 'cause it gets them where they wanna go. If they don't break rank, they're as racist as he is. And let's not forget that.Do your side projects â€“ designing bike racks, writing books â€“ feed into the music?You can only slog away at writing a song for so long and then you've kind of gotten the water out of that well â€“ and you need to let the well fill up again. I also compartmentalize a lot. I focus on one thing for a few hours and then break for lunch and work on something else. You take a little break from recording or whatever and go, ""OK, let's breathe in something else and see if it brings a little bit of an inspiration somewhere.""You once said you've avoided a Talking Heads reunion because it would overshadow the other things you've done. Is it really that simple?There's a lot to that. I see what happens with other people when they do their reunions â€“ and then it turns into a second reunion and a third reunion. With someone like the Pixies, it's different â€“ they're getting the audience now that they deserved ages ago. But with a lot of them, it just seems like you don't have anything new to say, and you go, ""OK, this is just some kind of nostalgia exercise."" And I'm not interested in that.""What would be the challenge is if I can take the ideas floating all around us and put them into an awkward white-man attitude and body.""You have a classic David Byrneâ€“ism on this album: ""We're only tourists in this life/Only tourists, but the view is nice."" Where did that come from?It was one of those where you worry, ""Has someone used this before?"" Clearly, I'm not the first one to say this, but maybe I'm the first one to say it in my particular way. The tone is kind of a little bit of melancholy, with a lot of goofy wonder and amazement all at the same time.You were an early target of cultural-appropriation debates, particularly with 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, which sampled Lebanese and Egyptian singers. How do you see all that now?As a performer, even early on, I thought, ""It's a rock &amp; roll thing,"" but I'm not gonna go out and pretend to be a black man â€“ you're aware of people where the appropriation seems a little too close, so it seems more like imitation. What would be the challenge is if I can take the ideas floating all around us and put them into an awkward white-man attitude and body. But The Bush of Ghosts is particularly thorny. It's not even somebody learning another culture's guitar style or whatever, which to me is totally legitimate â€“ I mean, a lot of African guitar bands are imitating Cuban music. But on that album, you actually hear the voices of people from other cultures. When it's somebody's voice, some part of a soul has been appropriated. I'm not talking shit about my own album, but I totally understand why it might feel that way.You're a fan of Selena Gomez's ""Bad Liar,"" which samples ""Psycho Killer."" Doesn't it bum you out to hear your music so decontextualized, though?No, no, not at all. I mean, I would have an issue if somebody took, say, ""This Must Be the Place,"" which is a very personal love song â€“ if somebody repurposed that and made it into some kind of horrible violent thing, I would probably say, ""No, you do not have permission to do this."" Other than that, yeah, repurpose the stuff. That's totally fine. And, you know, we get paid for it too. So thank you, Selena Gomez!

""The hardest part of it all was the 'kitchen sink element,'"" Lars Ulrich tells Rolling Stone. ""There's a certain exaggerated, perverse beauty in just overwhelming people with as much stuff as possible, but there is also some line in the sand somewhere where it just gets to be too much. If we included everything from that time period, you would need a fucking forklift to get this thing into your house.""Ulrich says he and the rest of the band were able to pare down the set's contents by asking themselves, what would a fan want to hear? In addition to remastering the original album, they ultimately settled on a selection of riff tapes, demos, rough mixes, interviews and concert recordings that cover the making of the LP from the songwriting process to the last leg of the touring behind it. The concert recordings include gigs where they were opening for Ozzy Osbourne, a few headlining shows, their last concert with bassist Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident while on tour) and, among others, their first with his replacement, Jason Newsted. The box set â€“ out Friday â€“ features vinyl, CDs, a cassette, DVDs, a hardcover book, reproductions of handwritten lyrics, buttons and a lithograph; the reissue will also be available in more affordable single-disc and three-CD versions.In the 31 years since Master of Puppets came out, it has become one of the most influential albums in metal. The lightning-fast riffing of ""Battery,"" ""Disposable Heroes"" and ""Damage Inc."" set the bar for thrash metal in the mid-Eighties, as it infiltrated the mainstream via Metallica's opening slot for Osbourne's tour, while tracks like the crushing ""The Thing That Should Not Be,"" moody ""Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"" and proggy ""Orion"" showed that the genre was capable of so much more than speed. Meanwhile, the intricate title track balanced furious and more introspective passages, and became the band's anthem â€“ the song they've played most at concerts and the most-requested song on their recent ""Metallica by Request"" tour. The record ranked Number Two (behind only Black Sabbath's Paranoid) on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Metal Albums list and has since been certified sextuple platinum.In anticipation of the collection's release, Ulrich and guitarist Kirk Hammett spoke with Rolling Stone about all the things they've documented with the reissue of Master of Puppets.What are you most excited about in the box set? Kirk Hammett: I'm excited about the rehearsal tapes and the live stuff, because it's just cool. It's beyond the normal.Lars Ulrich: I have always been a fan of the booklets and looking at every little nuance, every piece of paper, every lyric, every ticket and every little wakeup sheet when it comes to other big box sets. So hopefully the fans are going to appreciate this even more. And there's maybe additional emotional elements to this, since we're tackling Cliff's untimely passing. There's audio of his last show and potentially what may be the last picture that was ever taken of us together onstage. So with things like that, you pause for a second and think of all the craziness and ups and downs and how much we miss Cliff, but also how fortunate we are to still be out here doing it and that people still care. Let's talk about some of the curiosities in the set. There's a rough mix of a cover song by Fang called ""The Money Will Roll Right In."" What's the story behind that? Ulrich: ""The Money Will Roll Right In"" was something we were just playing around with. Most of the cover songs in the early days were stuff that we had played when we started out as a covers band; ""The Money Will Roll Right In"" was more something that fell into our lap. I think Cliff may have brought it in, and it was more of a last-minute kind of thing. Hammett: I can't remember who played on ""The Money Will Roll Right In."" I know Lars and James did, but I can't remember if Cliff did. I remember I didn't, because by the time it came around to me the track itself sounded too polished and too refined. Fang's version was really raw; it sounded like they had an afternoon to lay down eight songs and that it was done in one take. With us, when we recorded it, it was a little too glossy sounding, somewhat overplayed. We caught none of the punk simplicity and rawness [laughs], which is why it didn't end up being released. I never expected it to be released, but here we go.Ulrich: At the time, we took recording very seriously â€“ you gotta get the best sounds, you gotta get the kick drum sound from the last Def Leppard album â€“ so our M.O. was to record some cover songs and by the time we got to our song then we would have the sounds dialed in. So instead of experimenting with a couple of our songs, we would experiment with covers.There's a bootleg of you guys playing it live in '85 at Ruthie's Inn that sounds pretty raw. Hammett: Yeah, there was a time when we would play it because the album was in rotation and Fang played every other weekend, because we were in the Bay Area and I saw them often.Did you ever hear Nirvana's cover of the song? They played it at Reading in 1992. Hammett: No, I had no idea. Wow. I had no idea they were even aware of Fang. They weren't the most popular punk band in the Bay Area. That is totally weird.The other interesting cover here is Diamond Head's ""The Prince,"" which I didn't realize you'd recorded during Cliff's time in the band. You later re-recorded it with Jason Newsted around â€_ And Justice for All. Why didn't you release this one? Hammett: I think what happened with that one is we might not have cleared it with Diamond Head at that point. Or maybe we were working a deal out with Diamond Head, I don't know. It was the business end of it.Ulrich: As we got further into the project and we were working under a deadline, we decided not to put vocals on it and to focus our time and energy on the songs that were going on the record. One of the more curious things is that the rough mix of ""Orion"" features synthesizers during the intro. Why was that? Hammett: We thought it would be cool to have a keyboard beginning. We wanted to use more of a Hammond organ or B-3 sound, so those synths were there just to mark the spot.Who played them? Hammett: I can't remember. When it comes to keyboard parts in the studio, I think most of us are one-finger keyboard players.A lot of the recordings are pretty similar to what made the cut on the album. Do you remember experimenting much with the songs? Ulrich: No. At the time, we were so protective of anybody fucking with what we were doing that we didn't change much of it. If you changed it, that would be giving in. We never really sent any of it to the record company or to management. And I don't mean this disrespectfully, but we didn't really consider Flemming [Rasmussen] a producer in that sense. He was more like an engineer that was there to record and get the best sound and make it sound big. In our minds at the time a producer was somebody that would fuck with your stuff and try to make it more radio-friendly or tame it down. So it was like, ""No producers."" There was a very defiant mood in the band, so if you listen to the demos to the final album versions, there's not much in terms of different arrangements, though in the studio we embellished them. James especially loves tinkering with sounds in the studio and was very into some Queen stuff on the production side. But no producer was going to come in and tell us what to do.But weren't you trying to get Rush's Geddy Lee to produce the album at some point? Ulrich: Wow [pauses]. I believe he may have been on a very, very short list of people that we may have had a conversation with.What do you remember about how the lyrics came together for the album? Ulrich: At the time, James would go off into his own world and handwrite them, and the lyrics would come from talking about different things. ""The Thing That Should Not Be"" has its origins in the H.P. Lovecraft mythology; ""Disposable Heroes"" came out of talking about just being just a tool in somebody else's war; ""Leper Messiah"" I think, was something Kirk suggested that came on with a David Bowie song, and at that time obviously the Jimmy Swaggarts and the Jerry Falwells and all those dudes that were on TV all the time. And we'd sit around and watch TV a lot, and there was a lot of stuff on TV that would trigger lyric ideas, and just sitting around and watching those evangelists do their whole thing, you know, ""Send me money and I'll heal you,"" and all that type of stuff. Obviously they had an effect on us at the time [with ""Leper Messiah""]. ""Damage, Inc."" and ""Battery,"" were just about the family of fans and that sense of belonging to something greater than yourself. ""Master of Puppets"" was obviously about the addiction and all that stuff, and it was somewhat inspired by our friend, Rich Birch â€“ who was the one quoted on the back of Kill 'Em All, ""Bang that head that doesn't bang"" â€“ he used to crash on the couch of James' and I's house and he would wake up and chop his breakfast on a mirror and then get going. Listen, we loved the guy to death, and he was a good friend of ours, so it wasn't a judgment, but it was just about how people rolled at the time. Kirk, there are a lot of riff tapes in the box set showing your sketches for solos. How did you work out your lead breaks back then? Hammett: Back then, I was really into composing the entire solo, beginning to end. I wanted to have it at least 80 to 90 percent complete before going into the studio. I didn't improvise in the studio. I was young, and I didn't really have the development in my playing or the ability to show up with nothing and then put down 500 ideas. I can do that now because I'm so much more of a musician now; with ""Hardwired"" I had no idea what I was gonna play and I figured it out within 90 minutes. I couldn't do that in 1986. With ""Damage Inc.,"" I would have just sat there and been scratching my head with a dumbfounded look thinking, ""What else am I gonna play?""There isn't anything in the box set from Cliff's tapes. How did he present songs to the band? Hammett: He played the intro to ""Damage Inc.,"" with the volume swells, and then he played me the tune that was the inspiration for that, which is a Bach piece. And he said, ""Does it sound alike?"" and I said, ""No way, man. You're totally in the clear. It sounds completely like your own thing."" And he wrote the whole middle bit in ""Orion"" on bass and then worked out the harmony parts on guitar but played them on bass. On the record, James and I were playing all this harmony and initially Cliff wanted to do all of those harmonies on bass. It wouldn't have worked because it would have been more of a solo sort of thing, like the thing in ""Damage Inc."" So we integrated it into ""Orion"" and came up with the guitar-bass arrangement that's on the album. That was his swan song, really.There are a lot of cool concert recordings in here. What do you remember most about these shows? Ulrich: When I think back to Master of Puppets, I think back to the Ozzy tour. We spent more time on the road with Ozzy than anyone else. We would sometimes play our own shows when we were not with Ozzy, and I think the Aragon Ballroom gig was one of those. Hammett: I distinctly remember playing ""Disposable Heroes"" at the Aragon Ballroom show and watching the crowd go absolutely bat-shit fucking crazy. ""Disposable Heroes"" was not in our support-slot set, so I got the idea of how effective that song was live. Ulrich: The Hampton Coliseum show [in the box set] was with Ozzy. People had no idea what was hitting them. They'd never seen anything like what we were doing. We'd play all these middle-American arenas and play ""Battery"" and ""Master of Puppets"" and the look on a lot of people's faces was pretty crazy. Hammett: I remember the Meadowlands show being particularly good because the night before, James, Cliff and I were hanging out with the Samhain guys. It was really cool to be hanging out with them, and I remember Eerie [Von] and Glenn being at the show and us being excited about that fact and being really inspired and wanting to play a really good show because fucking Glenn from the Misfits and the Samhain guys were there. Like, ""We gotta put on a good show."" That's what inspired my playing.What do you remember about the Hampton Coliseum show, which featured Kirk's guitar tech, John Marshall, on rhythm guitar, since James had injured himself skateboarding? Hammett: John started out that tour on the side of the stage, but Cliff would constantly say, ""Get your butt out here."" So the funny thing is John would start the show from behind the stage but by the third or fourth song, he was out standing in front of the amp. By the fourth show, we just said, ""It doesn't really jive well with you standing off to the side and then all of a sudden you're on the stage. Come out for the first fuckin' song."" And I've known John Marshall since I was 13 years old, and we played guitar together since we were 15, so for him and I it was a trippy thing 'cause all of a sudden him and I were playing guitar together on the Ozzy tour. It was a weird sort of thing for us to experience. It was really trippy and cool.Ulrich: The Hampton Coliseum show was the last one of the Ozzy tour. We had a lot of fun during Ozzy's set later. We invaded the stage, and we all had diapers on and we came out with our guitars and silly wigs. That was also the show where our manager, Cliff [Burnstein], told us that the album had gone gold, and that was kind of crazy. It was also Hetfield's birthday.Is it emotional listening to the cassette of Cliff's last show, which was in Stockholm? Ulrich: Obviously, we're 31 years past this. So you pause, you reflect, you think, you appreciate, you're humbled. I move so fast through a lot of the stuff that I never slow down long enough to reflect. And occasionally, when you sit with some of the stuff at 2 o'clock in the morning, you go, ""Wow."" When you sit there and listen to the last two songs or look at the pictures from the last show with him, it stops you in your tracks as you deal with it.What do you remember about the final show with Cliff? Ulrich: We'd finished playing all the ""odeons"" in England, which are these old, 3,000-seat movie theaters and we got to Scandinavia where they were more like ice-hockey holes â€“ smaller, colder, darker. It was a different vibe. We played the show in Stockholm, and it went incredibly well. I think it may have been a rare case where we actually played an additional song that wasn't on the set list, because the show was so good. That's not something we did a lot then or now. So there was a good vibe.Hammett: It was significant because it was the first show where James played guitar again. He strapped on a guitar and was able to play the encore; I think it was ""Blitzkrieg"" or something. But I remember the five of us, including John Marshall, being really stoked James was back and playing and looking like was gonna make a pretty healthy recovery. I distinctly remember that show being good, and the feeling when we got offstage was really great and positive and forward-looking. Like, ""Great, James is back in and it won't be long 'til we're back to our old selves again."" It was that kind of mood after the show and then the accident happened and it literally felt like we were going from a hopeful sort of circumstance to one where we found ourselves in into a deep, black pit.Ulrich: We did a lot of press that day, and we did a photo shoot for a Swedish magazine called OK, which was almost like a teenybopper magazine. We were sitting on the bus afterwards, talking about how cool it was, and Cliff and I were hanging out, having a beer. It's a little fuzzy now but it was a good day.Hammett: I remember right when we were about to leave in the bus, the fans started running towards us. And Cliff said, ""Look at them. They look like zombies!"" He was way into zombies. We were all just kind of laughing. Then we started playing cards. And we had a long, long drive. And everyone knows the rest of it.&nbsp;The box set also has Jason Newsted's first audition and first gig. I imagine that was a rough time. Ulrich: Yeah, we didn't know what was up, down or sideways, and we decided that the smartest thing we could do was to keep going. We laid Cliff to rest a week or two after the accident, and then there wasn't five minutes after that [to process it] because if we slowed down, we were afraid we were going to disappear into nothingness or go so far into the abyss that we wouldn't be able to pull ourselves up. So I called a few people, including [Metal Blade Records founder] Brian Slagel, and said, ""Who are the guys out there that were the hot bass players?"" And we set up auditions the week after Cliff's funeral.Hammett: It was weird. We were all very nervous about the first show back. Things sounded good in rehearsal, and we were wondering if Jason would be able to cut it live. You can rehearse with someone 'til the cows come home, but once you go on tour, and being away from home and playing shows, that's what really separates the men from the boys. There are no manuals or training courses. And Jason was good at it. He really rose to the occasion.Ulrich: Jason had this incredibly useful positive energy and was like a fireball. He came in and was gung-ho and ready; he just had the right attitude, the chemistry and his personality and approach to his instrument were really unique. And he could not have been more of a 180 from Cliff, so it wasn't like were getting a ""Cliff Junior"" replacement. I remember having a gut feeling that Jason was the one to beat. From when you started writing Master to the end of your touring for the album with Jason Newsted, the box set covers only about two years of your life, yet so much happened in that time. What do you make of that? Hammett: There was a responsibility for the band's future that was just thrust upon us. Before September 1986, the band's future looked super rosy. But by October, we had no idea if we were ever gonna play together again. And we had lost a brother. It forces you to take stock mentally and emotionally. And we grew up a lot, 'cause by the next tour, we were a little more mature. We were a bit more focused. We were also playing well. And out of that desire to play well came [1988's] â€_ And Justice for All.Cliff Burton once said that ""Master of Puppets"" was his favorite Metallica song and the band's best song yet. It's since become the group's most-requested tune and the song you've played the most. Why do you think it has endured? Hammett: It cycles through a lot of great emotions. It's really atmospheric in the middle part. It's super heavy and it has good energy. It has a lot of emotion. After I either listen to or play ""Master of Puppets,"" I feel like I've purged something. The greatest music is like that â€“ you either gain something or it helps you get rid of something emotionally. ""Master of Puppets"" is an incredibly cathartic song. It hits on emotions that people could relate to that just need to be brought to the fore and that song does it. People feel better for it afterwards.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,Maura Johnston,2017-12-13T17:33:00.000Z,Why Bon Jovi Belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"bon jovi, rock and roll hall of fame, jon bon jovi, mtv unplugged, richie sambora, bon jovi rock and roll hall of fame, bon jovi mtv, livin on a prayer",Rolling Stone,"Bon Jovi's forthcoming Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction will certainly come as a surprise to some. The New Jerseyâ€“repping band, who dominated MTV and served as the pop-friendly face of the Eighties hair-metal boom, were hardly beloved by critics. A&nbsp;1986 Rolling Stone review of the band's mega-selling Slippery When Wet LP&nbsp;began with the question ""How many clichÃ©s can you squeeze into a pop song?"" while in 2005, critic Robert Christgau referred to them as ""hard rock so inoffensive it's less Aerosmith than Air Supply.""During the band's heyday, critics weren't too high on hard rock as a whole, and the success of Bon Jovi, who had camera-ready looks and a youthful fanbase to go along with their maximalist pop-rock anthems, especially rankled. Susan Orlean's 1987 Rolling Stone profile opened with a loving description of frontman Jon Bon Jovi's 14-inch shag (""it would be safe to say that Jon Bon Jovi has the most wonderful hair in rock &amp; roll today,"" she enthused) and mentioned the ad hoc focus-grouping that led to Slippery When Wet's track listing, Fair enough Â_â€“ Bon Jovi always kept an eye on the bottom line. But their blending of arena-rock largesse, pyrotechnic riffing and good-time vibes â€“ not to mention the occasional weepy ballad â€“ led to some of the most pleasure-inducing rock hits of the Eighties and Nineties. ""Livin' on a Prayer"" is amped-up Springsteen, a talkbox-assisted yarn about two hard-luck lovers clinging to each other in the wake of Reaganomics; Wild Westâ€“as-touring-life metaphor ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" has one of the most memorable backing-vocal turns in rock history (Richie Sambora's ""waaan-teeee-uuughhh-eed!""); and&nbsp;""Born to Be My Baby,"" which was co-written by Bon Jovi, guitarist Richie Sambora and hired-gun songwriter Desmond Child, is peak synth-metal, an attempt to reach the grandiosity of their contemporaries Def Leppard that succeeds because of its audacity. Ballads like the nostalgia-tinged ""Never Say Goodbye"" and the pleading ""I'll Be There for You"" are precision-grade tearjerkers that recall the weepiest moments of 2017 Rock Hall inductees Journey, only turned up to 11. And in later years, the band's tilt toward twangier sounds (like the 2006 Jennifer Nettles collaboration ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"") gave a tacit blessing to Nashville's full-on embrace of the melodic-arena-rock ideal. Bon Jovi's early success is a testament to the reach of radio. In 1982, Jon and a handful of session musicians recorded demos at the legendary New York studio the Power Station, which was co-owned by his cousin Tony Bongiovi. The urgent bad-girl chronicle ""Runaway"" was part of those sessions, and in 1983 Bon Jovi brought the song to the New York rock station WAPP, which was actively looking for locally sourced talent. It eventually landed on New York Rocks 1983, a compilation of then-unsigned artists that also featured the Long Island hard rockers Twisted Sister, which helped it circulate to stations around the country.Jon Bon Jovi's shaggy good looks also helped the band become a staple on MTV. The band gave a boost to upstarts like the bluesy Pennsylvania outfit Cinderella and the scuzz-glam outfit Skid Row (whose guitarist Dave ""The Snake"" Sabo grew up down the block from Jon), acted as a gateway to other artists from the Sunset Strip and beyond, and represented the States at the&nbsp;Moscow Music Peace Festival, the 1989 concert that brought a slew of those bands to the then-Soviet Union. Bon Jovi even got into a bit of hot water that same year with the clip for&nbsp;""Living in Sin,"" thanks to some quick-cut imagery of its young protagonist receiving Communion before getting it on with her boyfriend â€“ which MTV's standards and practices department forced them to remove before airing. The band also nudged forward the development of MTV Unplugged. In the MTV oral history I Want My MTV, producer Joel Gallen said that Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora's two-song acoustic performance at the 1989 MTV  VMAs was ""the jumping-off point"" for the show, which quickly became the music-video network's premier performance venue. Co-creator Jim Burns added that the medley of ""Livin' on a Prayer"" and ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" ""did help sell Unplugged to the network."" The Bon Joviâ€“Sambora duet, which showcased the pair's harmonies and allowed Richie Sambora to flaunt a double-necked acoustic axe, set the template for tons of awards-show performances by bands hoping to add a little bit of down-home cred to their frothy images â€“ and it also set the stage for the group's later forays into country crossover music. (Nashville's just a bit east of New Jersey, after all.)While Bon Jovi might be sneered at by purists, their widespread appeal and hooky anthems helped them become one of the standard-bearers for Eighties hard rock â€“ the yin to Guns N' Roses' gutter-punk yang, the American counterpart to the British rock fortress-builders Def Leppard. Their induction into the Rock Hall in April will help enshrine one of the biggest musical movements of the Eighties â€“ not to mention one of the most iconic grins of the early MTV era.&nbsp;&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,David Browne,2017-11-16T19:10:00.000Z,Inside the New Grateful Dead Musical,"grateful dead musical, red roses green gold, michael norman man, jerry garcia, box of rain, robert hunter, grateful dead play, grateful dead off broadway",Rolling Stone,"Musical-theater productions tend to gestate for long periods, but&nbsp;Red Roses, Green Gold, the Off-Broadway show featuring the music of the Grateful Dead that opened in October, still seems like a special case. Playwright Michael Norman Mann first had the idea for the show when he attended a Dead gig in the Nineties and remarked to a friend that he thought their songs could be turned into show tunes.""He took my beer away from me,"" Mann recalls, ""and said, 'You're done.'"" A few years later, when Mann got serious about creating a musical using Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter songs, skepticism prevailed: ""Even people who understood the band looked at me and said, 'What are you talking about? You think you can do that with these songs?' I would say, 'As a matter of fact, I do.'""Twenty years and several incarnations later, Mann has achieved the seemingly impossible with Red Roses, Green Gold. Set at the fictitious ""Palace Saloon and Mining Company in Cumberland, USA,"" the show, currently playing at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York's Greenwich Village, uses 18 Dead classics largely from the American Beauty and Workingman's Dead era, along with one new Hunter song, ""Drunkard's Carol."" The musical centers on a quasi-Appalachian family wrestling with ways to hold onto their bar and mine, and the songs â€“ which feature Hunter's tales of gamblers, devils, and rogues in them â€“ help accentuate that story.&nbsp;""We're treading in between a musical and Dead music,"" says co-producer Gigi Pritzker. ""So we're not going to go into 'Space.' No drum solo! But I love the way the songs allude to the story line but without the characters breaking into song to give you more plot. The songs are next to the plot.""Prior to getting to work on Red Roses, Green Gold, Mann, who graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz (coincidentally, currently home to the Dead's archives), had already written several plays, including the award-winning Box 27, about gays in the military. In 1997, he approached the Dead's publishing company, Ice Nine, for permission to use their songs in a possible musical and was encouraged to proceed, with input from Hunter. ""I didn't want to make it biographical,"" says Mann. ""I didn't want to write a play about the band or about people following the band on tour or a play about Sixties psychedelia. Hair covered that whole scene better than a Johnny-come-lately would."" Since he wasn't portraying band members, he didn't need permission from the surviving ""core four"" of the Dead.First called Cumberland Blues and using different characters and plots than the current show, the production opened in San Francisco in 1998. But despite positive reviews, it shut down after less than a week. ""It closed under the weight of its own expectations,"" Mann says. ""The lesson I learned was to slow down and be patient and not try to rush things.""In the meantime, Mann also worked with Hunter on Shakedown Street, a one-shot Dead musical that featured swing-jazz versions of later songs (""Shakedown Street,"" ""Stella Blue,"" ""Help on the Way/Slipnot!"", ""Loose Lucy"") in a detective-noir setting. Cumberland Blues was itself revived in 2005 at a theater festival. But it wasn't until five years ago that another overhauled crack at the show â€“ now renamed Red Roses, Green Gold and featuring new charactersâ€“ began taking shape. From the first show, Mann learned several lessons. ""The early production focused more on the dark and brooding,"" he says. ""We had 'Black Peter' in there. But not everyone wants to watch a man physically dying on stage. And I learned that if I wasn't careful, I could be repetitive. I'd want 'Candyman' and 'Friend of the Devil,' but they cover the same ground.""Mounting the show still presented challenges. Many big-money investors shied away. ""Some were like, 'I don't know if I want to touch this,'"" says Pritzker, a longtime stage and film producer who was also behind the Million Dollar Quartet musical based around Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. ""It was a little out of the box for a lot of people."" Pritzker and her partner Ted Rawlins' company, MWM Live, wound up providing the investment money themselves; to keep costs down, they decided on a small Off-Broadway theater instead of the Great White Way. The show's 11-person cast is among the most versatile in contemporary New York theater; throughout the show, each sings, acts and plays multiple instruments. But most had no knowledge of the Dead, so for the musical-supervisor job, Pritzker approached Jeff Chimenti, the longtime post-Garcia Dead accompanist who was in Furthur and now holds down the keyboard slot in Dead &amp; Co. ""They knew my background and needed some guidance,"" Chimenti says of the cast. ""Most of them didn't have any history with this music. I was teaching them as much as I could.""The resulting show features arrangements that are sometimes close to the Dead's originals and sometimes not. ""I wanted certain songs to be very rock-style like the Dead,"" says Mann, ""but I also wanted almost a throwback to the Sixties, when someone like Robert Goulet would walk to the front of the stage and you knew he was going to sing a ballad. I wanted to make 'Bertha' and 'The Wheel' big-time musical theater numbers. I step on Deadheads' toes every once in a while. Deadheads aren't as militant as Trekkies, but they share a lot of similarities.""For Chimenti, the ""a-ha"" moment arrived during rehearsal as he watched two of the cast members sing an unplugged ""Box of Rain."" ""When I realized it was going to be a duet, I was like, 'Wow, how's that going to sound?'"" he says. ""But it was thrilling to see it when it first happened. This isn't a show or a concert and people can't expect to hear the Dead versions of these songs. They have to be open to it.""Currently Red Roses, Green Gold is booked until January, with a possible extension. Mann knows the initial skepticism he encountered nearly two decades ago remains, but is hopeful his show will be given a chance. ""On opening night, people had no idea what to expect,"" he says. ""And if that works against us, then it works against us. But I think it works for us. In musical theater, there's nothing like being pleasantly surprised.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,Andy Greene,2017-11-24T14:00:00.000Z,50th Anniversary Flashback: Our Wild History With Kanye West,"kanye west, kanye, yeezus, kanye west rolling stone, kanye west cover story, kanye west rolling stone cover, kim kardashian, kanye west best quotes, kanye west interviews, where is kanye",Rolling Stone,"On the morning of July 29th, 2010, Rolling Stone's Twitter account sent out a message to Kanye West. ""Hey Kanye!"" it read. ""Since you're in NYC, come visit the Rolling Stone offices and rap for us!"" West had been previewing songs from his upcoming album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and writer Daniel Kreps thought he should play them for Rolling Stone. ""We did it as a joke,"" says Kreps, ""not anticipating he'd respond or actually come to the office.""But the next day, West burst into Rolling Stone's midtown headquarters with a laptop full of unreleased music. For the next two hours, the most gifted, most complicated musician of his generation holed up in a small conference room packed beyond capacity with staffers. After a hilarious speech in which he talked about an internship at the Italian fashion label Fendi, explained the album and compared himself to Daniel Day-Lewis, West ripped off the jacket of his designer suit, leapt onto the conference room table and rapped along to much of Dark Twisted Fantasy. He sometimes got so close to staffers that they had to wipe his spittle off their faces. ""He appeared to be actually weeping during 'Runaway,'â€‰"" says editor Christian Hoard. The visit was the most bizarre moment in Rolling Stone's relationship with West, which dates back to a short 2003 feature just ahead of the rapper's debut album. In that piece, and a handful of others, West proved himself an amazingly unfiltered interview, commenting on everything from his love of NoDoz to his belief that AIDS was created by the government. ""He is stream-of-conscious,"" says writer Lola Ogunnaike. ""He's so present, so raw, and that makes him a journalist's dream."" For his first Rolling Stone cover, in 2006, West infuriated the religious right by posing as Christ for photographer David LaChapelle. Ogunnaike wrote the story after watching West obsessively work on a track for the Mission: Impossible III soundtrack in an L.A. studio. ""He was so committed to getting every line, stanza or note right,"" Ogunnaike says. She finally got an interview â€“ after watching him work for 13 hours. Writer Austin Scaggs had to wait even longer when he traveled to London for another cover story in 2007. Scaggs accompanied West and Rihanna to a strip club and chilled with him backstage, but West was constantly distracted. After a week of this, Scaggs finally interviewed him during a five-hour drive across England. ""He had no access to the Internet, and it was so dark he couldn't see out the window,"" says Scaggs. ""Once I had his focus, he was unbelievable.""Weeks after the issue hit stands, West's mother, Donda, died suddenly. ""I don't think he was fully able to process that loss,"" says Ogunnaike. ""She'd been his emotional and mental anchor and his biggest cheerleader."" After Donda's death, West talked to the press much less; several planned Rolling Stone interviews collapsed at the last moment. ""I was supposed to do a Q&amp;A with him at one point,"" says Scaggs. ""But the whole interview turned into a 40-minute conversation about why he didn't want to do the interview.""Setting up a story with West was a roller-coaster ride. ""He wanted total control over the photo process,"" says former editor Nathan Brackett. ""He also wanted to literally control every piece of type in the article."" In 2016, West insisted that his friend Tyler, the Creator shoot his cover photo on his iPhone. After Rolling Stone declined those terms, West posted the photo to Twitter with the Rolling Stone logo on top and the baffling cover line kanye: does he like mustard? Rolling Stone had to clarify with its own tweet: ""While we love Kanye, and have many mustard-related questions for him, this is not an actual cover of Rolling Stone."" (Kim Kardashian responded: ""It Should Be.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰."") All of which makes West's openness during his office visit more remarkable. After playing his album, West began asking every person in the jammed room to tell him their favorite band or artist. With deadlines pressing, staffers began to excuse themselves. ""His publicist was like, 'OK, we are going to go now,'â€‰"" Kreps recalls. ""So I never got to tell Kanye how much I loved the Beta Band.""""Kanye didn't want people to leave,"" says Brackett. ""In a way, you could see it was kind of a metaphor for his whole career. He's this incredible genius, but the force of his personality would eventually wear you down. It's a shame he doesn't talk to the press anymore. He is one of the all-time great interviews.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,Suzy Exposito,2018-02-13T19:07:00.000Z,"Code Orange: Metal's Rising Stars on Their Grammy Nod, Breakthrough Year","code orange, code orange rolling stone, code orange forever, code orange grammys",Rolling Stone,"Two weeks before the Grammys, Code Orange drummer-vocalist Jami Morgan is admiring the outfit he'll be wearing on the red carpet: a bespoke black fur coat. He never thought he'd possess something like this, let alone sport it during such a high-stakes occasion.""After we announced the nomination, I got a message on Twitter,"" recounts Morgan in his band's three-bedroom home in Pittsburgh, less than a mile away from where the members grew up together. He pulls up a photo of the coat on his phone. ""This lady Bonnie Resinski, she's a costume designer. She offered to make me whatever I wanted to wear at the Grammys. I just hope nobody throws a can of red paint at me.""The thunderous title track from Code Orange's major-label debut,&nbsp;Forever&nbsp;â€“ an album that masterfully blends aggro hardcore, brooding alt-rock and sleek industrial textures â€“ had been nominated for Best Metal Performance. As the genre's rookies of the year, Code Orange would compete against a plethora of veterans, such as Southern prog-metal&nbsp;outfit Mastodon, Ice-Tâ€“fronted Body Count and Swedish heavy hitters Meshuggah (who invited Code Orange to open their recent West Coast tour). The Grammy nod was unusual for a category long monopolized by grizzled legends like Metallica and Slayer. In another plot twist, Code Orange guitarist-vocalist Reba Meyers would become the third woman ever nominated in the metal category, offering a tiny jolt of morale after&nbsp;an otherwise disheartening year for women in music.""With much respect to the other bands,"" Morgan says, ""we have to go in there like we've already won.""Morgan's bravado can seem like little more than hot air. Yet the 24-year-old's deep-seated ambition, coupled with his uncanny ability to harness the law of attraction,&nbsp;often gets the goods.&nbsp;The Grammy nomination was just the latest of major strides for the band: They signed to major label Roadrunner Records;&nbsp;they've made it onto a billboard in Times Square; they became the first band to perform at WWE's NXT Takeover: Brooklyn;&nbsp;and they've opened for influential bands like Gojira, Deftones and System of a Down, and even joined mathcore legends Dillinger Escape Plan in their final run of shows.&nbsp;In light of these developments, the words to ""Forever"" start to seem like a mantra:&nbsp;The freaks will finally have their say/There is nothing you can do to take it.""The whole band has become about self-actualization by visualizing it,"" says Morgan, leaning back into&nbsp;his leather recliner. ""You visualize where you want to be, who you want to be, and become it. That was the impetus for our last record, I Am King. The Forever record was very much about the reaction to that new power, learning about yourself, and each other in the process. Growing into that power as a unit ... and creating a legacy.""The band formerly known as Code Orange Kids â€“ a throwback to post-9/11 panic â€“Â_Â_ started while its members attended the Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School. Today, their members are Morgan on drums, Meyers and Dominic Landolina on guitars, Joe Goldman on bass, and Eric ""Shade"" Balderose on synths and guitar. ""This is the core,"" says Morgan. ""This is the best lineup we've ever had.""During the late 2000s, the band established a rapport with other outfits in the Rust Belt's DIY punk and hardcore scene, even sharing a stage with local anarcho-punk heavyweights Anti-Flag. But theirs was a mold Code Orange couldn't quite fill from the start. ""Our early songs sucked,"" Morgan laughs. ""We dabbled in some Rock Against Bush-type shit, but that wasn't us. I'm not gonna shoot my mouth off about anything I can't explain.""Some members later embarked on a fleeting venture through emo with their popular side project, Adventures. Worlds away from their work in Code Orange, that group took its cues from Nineties indie rock bands like&nbsp;Knapsack and Helium. ""I was still learning how to play guitar and sing at the same time,"" says Meyers, who is also a classically trained flutist. ""Every song we wrote in Adventures sounded like a different band ...&nbsp;but not necessarily the band we wanted to be.""Years of experimentation and technical discipline drove the band deeper into the trenches of a fiercer&nbsp;sound. ""Our old records were about me feeling very depressed, dealing with all these feelings,"" sneers Morgan, the band's chief lyricist. (Meyers, Code Orange's resident grammarian, duly edits each line.) ""But I didn't feel any better; it didn't do anything for my growth. So I decided to write songs about feeling good about myself and about the group. Then the songs just got heavier.""&nbsp;While opening a Braddock, Pennsylvania, punk fest in 2011, Code Orange piqued the interest of the headlining band,&nbsp;metalcore architects Converge â€“ a crucial influence on the Code Orange sound. Frontman Jacob Bannon, founder of independent label Deathwish Inc., signed Code Orange just a few months later; guitarist Kurt Ballou would become their long-time engineer and co-producer. Along with Adventures producer Will Yip, Ballou would help produce Forever.&nbsp;""I know I made terrible music at their age,"" Ballou tells Rolling Stone. ""So to see these young, proficient songwriters with such raw talent and potential was impressive to me.""The untethered punk stylings of early Code Orange tracks like ""Flowermouth (The Leech)"" â€“ from the band's 2012 debut, Love Is Love/Return to Dust â€“&nbsp;gave way to the sludgy, lurching grooves of I Am King's ""Dreams in Inertia."" Forever unveiled a more sculpted brutality enhanced by Balderose's increasingly prominent electronics. The album as a whole harks back to metal's Nineties makeover,&nbsp;when heritage acts like Korn, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson introduced a digitally enhanced form of heavy rock&nbsp;with an affection for the grotesque.""We didn't really see that metallic Nineties influence coming,"" says Ballou. ""But I think that each generation of musicians needs to find a way to set themselves apart from the generation that came before. It was important for them to forge ahead and maybe even confuse some of us older people in that pursuit.""Whatever macho theatrics Code Orange absorbed from their predecessors is offset by Meyers' inimitable&nbsp;snarl, which cuts through the melee of Morgan and Balderose's death growls.&nbsp;She takes the lead on ""Bleeding in the Blur,"" a melodic, grungy interlude amid Forever's aural horror show, and wades trance-like through the gothic fugue state of album closer ""dream2.""""There always was this layer of internal pressure from being the only girl involved in the heavy music scene,"" Meyers admits. ""But I used hurdles like that as motivation to overcome the expectation. It shouldn't have to be that way, but since it is, I take advantage.""Meanwhile, in the spirit of John Carpenter and Trent Reznor, self-taught mastermind Balderose adds a chilling ambient wash to Morgan's evocative tales of vengeance and isolation.&nbsp;""I design everything with the live performance in mind,"" says Balderose. ""[Morgan] gives me an adjective for every song and I think ... 'OK, this is the spot where everyone can take a breath, and this is where everyone wants to jump out of their skin.'""The band convenes at Mad Mex, a Southwestern joint in Pittsburgh's snowcapped Shadyside neighborhood. The first Grammy-nominated rock band from Pittsburgh spars over the minutiae of their high school careers â€“ beginning with their school's contentious Battle of the Bands. ""The kids had to vote for you to compete in the first place,"" says Morgan. ""Nobody voted for us that year, but we're cool with those kids now. Our city's been very supportive.""The band has little desire to leave Pittsburgh, much less the enclave they've built around each other. After all, they've done nearly everything together for years; for some, even dating back to grade school. They compare old GPAs and bad-behavior reports, one of which they distinctly recall had Balderose banned from recess. ""They called me overtly aggressive,"" Balderose snickers from behind a veil of long brown hair,&nbsp;which he'll dye a shocking, alien blue in time for the Grammys. ""I threw dirt over a fence.""Balderose is recouping from a massive setback. The previous week in Tampa, a backpack containing his passport, computer and other electronics â€“ even a hard drive with backup files â€“ went missing after their one-off show at FYA Fest. This meant the loss of original materials dating back to I Am King, which left Balderose just one week to replicate every track before the West Coast tour.""It's like rewriting the record for me,"" says Balderose. ""I have to rebuild and remix the auxiliary sounds of Forever, including voice samples and drum sounds and everything else, from memory on a new computer. The whole ordeal has almost driven me to a psychotic break, but my setup and my workflow is better than before.""Just as Balderose begins to describe the process, Morgan interrupts and brings up an unrelated bit of band business: the color of their merch, which he designs with the help of Balderose. ""Every record has a color associated with it,"" explains Morgan. ""Our merch is currently lime green, but the color should be hunter."" Back at his apartment, Morgan pulls out a book of Pantone swatches for reference, signed and gifted to him by Roadrunner's retired art director, Lynda Kusnetz. He unfurls the swatches like a paper fan and points to the color. ""You have to give them the name, otherwise they won't get the right one.""As the son of a union organizer, Morgan grew up making signs and attending marches with his dad â€“ an experience that seems to inform his cutthroat leadership style. ""We worked mostly with the janitors' and security unions,"" Morgan says. ""I was out there all the fucking time, no matter what kind of weather. Now I feel some type of way when people just throw their shit around.""""You visualize where you want to be, who you want to be, and become it."" â€“Jami MorganIn spite of their label's in-house resources, the band finds it hard to relinquish the doggedly indie approach that sustained them for years. ""All our favorite bands are on Roadrunner,"" says Morgan. ""But I had meetings with every department and told them we already did everything ourselves.""""People who like our band, and know our band, know that [signing to] Roadrunner was a good move for us,"" adds Meyers. ""The label has been super helpful, but they understand that we gotta do things our way. For 10 years we wrote our own shit, designed our own shit and promoted it. We're not doing this stuff from inside an office â€“ we see how people engage with our stuff on the road, in real time. This job is really a bunch of different jobs.""&nbsp;Prior to their feverish year of big promos and tours, the band members made rent money through construction work, delivery and some other odd jobs. Landolina, who joined the band full-time upon&nbsp;Forever's release, just worked his final shift at the pizza shop last month. ""I can get used to this,"" he laughs. He pops in a VHS of Type O Negative's After Dark video â€“ a tongue-in-cheek look at life on the road. The group has watched it so many times that the goth band's toilet humor hardly elicits a response. ""Sure, we can fuck off sometimes,"" says Morgan over the shrill sounds of an organ. ""But we work hard. We're showing Dom the ropes now too.""&nbsp;Morgan relishes commitment, repetition and most of all control â€“ which is why he and Goldman took up jiu jitsu three years ago. (Balderose did too, until his arm popped out of its socket a few months in.) When they're not on tour, the guys attend class in a small gym across town, up to six times a week. ""I'd be fucked up without the structure to be honest,"" says Morgan. In addition to working out most days, he and Goldman (as well as Meyers) have adopted a substance-free lifestyle, which they say helps build the stamina for months of touring.""Being straightedge is not our gimmick,"" says Goldman. Onstage, the bassist adopts&nbsp;an impenitent, neck-vein-bursting Mr. Hyde persona, a foil to the even-keeled Dr. Jekyll he plays in the daylight. He drives serenely around the band's childhood neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, his signature red beard stark against the snow banks. ""Our music's not about straightedge,"" he says. ""It's not something we want to sell people. It's a personal choice.""In lieu of drugs and alcohol, the guys partake in other vices: Morgan stops by a cafÃ© to indulge his inner coffee snob. Meanwhile, Goldman and I rifle through assorted sweets at the supermarket across the lot. ""I've been straightedge my whole life,"" explains Morgan on the drive home. ""I never even tried anything, but I know I have an addictive personality. I just worry about acting like an idiot, losing control of myself and my life.""""Not to be rude,"" interjects Goldman, ""but if one of you doesn't open this bag of cookies right now, I'm going to lose my shit.""The morning of the Grammys begins more like Night of the Living Dead, as the band recovers from a red-eye flight between LAX and NYC. All too aware of the scarcity of a Grammy invite, the band dipped out of their tour with Meshuggah to catch the ceremony. They are greeted by a crack team of hairdressers and stylists in a Manhattan hotel, but it isn't until later that the results of the session really sink in. ""We put on our clothes,"" recalls Balderose after the ceremony, ""we saw each other, and that's just when we realized how insane we looked.""On the red carpet, Code Orange nabbed media attention with looks fit for an elaborate heist film: Landolina in a ski mask and Type O Negative shirt; Morgan in his custom fur coat; Meyers' comic-bookâ€“heroine locks; Goldman in a Kanye-approved Alyx vest; and Balderose in a blue trench coat and Doc Martens to match his hair. (He even got a nod from emo-rap prince Lil Uzi Vert.) But in a climate where this year's pre-Grammys schedule included a counter-terrorism briefing, the band met the gaze of a hypervigilant security force.""We came to steal that gold,"" Morgan laughs on the phone the following Thursday. ""Which is why they double-searched us.""Code Orange didn't walk away with the gold for Best Metal Performance that day â€“ instead, the honor would go to Mastodon. But the band was determined to ride out the televised part of the ceremony as a learning experience: marveling over the radical theater of Kendrick Lamar, and fighting sleep during most everything else, with Landolina quietly stewing in his ski mask throughout the night.""We were really just there to make a statement and call attention to what we do,"" says Meyers. ""Typically that world overlooks real heavy music completely. Even though we didn't win, we were able to get noticed.""On the red carpet, Meyers was routinely prompted to explain her own success as a young female musician. ""Me just being at the Grammys speaks for itself,"" she told Rolling Stone at the ceremony. ""But I had a community that gave me opportunity in the same way as anyone. Young girls need to be supported and encouraged by their peers at a young age, and boys need to be shown a good example by their parents and role models. For me, my peers didn't question our inherent equality and I didn't either.""The band is back home in Pittsburgh now â€“ humbled, but ready to hone their focus&nbsp;more than ever before. On a welcome respite from tour, Morgan plans to spend the next two months home writing new songs, hopefully earning his purple belt in jiu jitsu and plotting the band's next Grammys showdown. ""I don't want this to be our defining moment,"" says Morgan. ""I think it's just our very first foray into a bit of a bigger world.""""Why even tell the story now?"" he asks. ""In 10 years it'll be a lot crazier than this. This story's just begun.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,Elias Leight,2018-01-25T14:31:00.000Z,How the Grammys Finally Got Woke,"Grammys, beyonce, Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, ",Rolling Stone,"On February 12th, 2017, Frank Ocean published a blunt dismissal of the Grammys on Tumblr. ""You know what's really not 'great tv,' guys?"" Ocean asked. ""[Taylor Swift's] 1989 getting album of the year over [Kendrick Lamar's] To Pimp a Butterfly. Hands down one of the most 'faulty' TV moments I've seen."" Ocean's post reflected a widely held view: At best, the Grammys appeared to reflect what he called ""cultural bias""; at worst, the Recording Academy was systematically ignoring the work of innovative minority acts. His opinion was supported by Kanye West, who called the Grammys ""way off and completely out of touch,"" and Drake, who reportedly refused to submit his Views album for Grammy consideration (following Ocean, who did the same with Blonde).Those artists had a strong case: Album of the Year has gone to a white act nine years in a row, and commercially successful, critically adored records by Ocean (Channel Orange), Kendrick Lamar (both good kid, m.A.A.d city&nbsp;and To Pimp a Butterfly) and BeyoncÃ© (both BeyoncÃ© and Lemonade) have failed to win the award five years straight. No rapper has ever won Record of the Year; the only non-white R&amp;B singer to take home that honor is Bruno Mars â€“ when he was a featured singer on Mark Ronson's ""Uptown Funk."" The 2018 Grammy nominations, however, are different. Four non-white acts are up for Album of the Year (Childish Gambino, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar and Bruno Mars). And five are up for Record of the Year (Gambino, Jay-Z, Lamar, Mars, and the ""Despacito"" team of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee). ""This is the year where people are saying, 'Oh wow, they got it right,'"" says Tunde Balogun, co-founder of creative agency LVRN, whose artists 6lack and D.R.A.M. both received nominations this year. This year also marks the first time in history that an all-minority slate of artists are nominated for Record of the Year, and the first time a Spanish-language song has ever been up for Record of the Year (""Despacito""). ""I'm very happy with the nominations,"" adds Chris Anokute, a manager, former major-label A&amp;R and Recording Academy voter. ""It's a new day for the Grammys.""&nbsp;The Academy has been attempting to make its Grammy-nomination process more representative for years. Anokute remembers attending long meetings ""about how we can make it more diverse and be a better partner to the music community as a whole."" An important part of this effort involves informing people who are eligible to vote but unaware they can participate in the Grammy process. Though musicians can join the voter pool as soon as they have six credits on commercial music releases, many people who qualify don't know that they are eligible to participate in the process. Artists also need to know to submit their work to the Recording Academy for Grammy consideration, or have a label with a well-organized operation to take care of that for them.LVRN's Balogun credits the Recording Academy for taking ""steps to educate people more on the process behind the nominations."" ""They made a huge effort to bring more people in this year for meetings, let them know how things work,"" he adds. Both 6lack and D.R.A.M. had separate sit-downs with officials at the Recording Academy. Terrence ""Punch"" Henderson, co-president of the label Top Dawg Entertainment, which saw its artists Kendrick Lamar and SZA receive multiple nominations apiece, also felt more in the loop this year. ""We all have to understand how the system actually moves,"" he says. ""I learned a lot this year when we went in and sat down with [the Recording Academy] and they gave us a bunch of information [about the nomination and voting process].""In addition, the Recording Academy moved to an online voting system for the first time in 2018, a move that's likely to raise turnout among younger voters used to living in the digital age. (The accounting firm Deloitte, which oversees the voting process, doesn't share turnout data.) ""A paper ballot is tough,"" Balogun says. ""People don't even check their mail anymore"" â€“ especially since the voting body includes musicians and producers, who travel frequently. Anokute didn't vote for last year's Grammys; he voted this year partially thanks to the ease of the online ballot. The new voting system also makes it easier to avoid mistakes, like casting a vote in too many categories (15 is the max, plus the four general categories), which nullifies your ballot.Another factor that surely improved the nomination process is the increasing dominance of streaming: It's never been easier to be a well-educated voter. A decade ago, a voter with a rock or country background voting on a general category may not have heard a hot rap single or a great R&amp;B album. In the world of Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube, voters have no excuse not to listen. ""Streaming helped to to quantify hip-hop and R&amp;B properly, so it's better represented,"" says Balogun. ""People see the impact on culture. In the past, people may have just voted for artists they had heard of. But maybe they did their research more this year -- If this song has 500 million streams, maybe I should check this out -- which is important for all of us.""&nbsp;In the second round of Grammy voting, the online ballot even has links to all the songs that are nominated to make it easier for voters to do their homework.Rap, R&amp;B and Latin pop music have fared particularly well in the streaming landscape, which has in turn been reflected in the Billboard charts, leading to news coverage and increased cultural awareness. ""That by its very nature is going to make this kind of selection process more in the moment, more in line with what is moving the fans,"" says Zane Lowe, creative director and L.A. host for Apple Music's Beats 1 radio. ""With streaming, you've seen hip-hop and R&amp;B become the most influential and successful genres of music, not just in terms of what they do for culture and the impact they've had in pop music, but also statistically."" Adds Anokute, ""You can't turn away from Cardi B, from Migos, from these acts that are cutting through. They got the popular vote.""Of course, winning the popular vote in America does not always mean you take home the big prize. And 2018 could turn out to be an outlier year, just like 2005, the only other year in Grammy history when four non-white acts were nominated for Album of the Year.&nbsp;But with artists from more genres and more age groups represented this year, from Balogun thinks a positive feedback loop will develop to help the Grammys' maintain this level of diversity moving forward. ""More people are going to feel like they're represented, which means more people will participate in the process,"" he says. ""And if more people participate, it will keep getting better."" &nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,Chris Martins,2017-12-19T16:32:00.000Z,Inside BTS-mania: A Day in the Life of the K-Pop Superstars ,"BTS, BTS AMAs, ARMY, BTS ARMY, K-pop, Korean pop, BTS America, BTS MIC Drop, bts band, bts kpop",Rolling Stone,"The screaming begins just beyond baggage claim, when the first bob of purple-gray hair peeks up over the security wall separating the biggest Korean pop band in the world, in history, from its fans. Amid shrill hysteria, the seven soft-faced men of BTS stride through Los Angeles International Airport flanked by human trains of burly people  in yellow ""Event Staff"" shirts. The boys smile, wave and, with the efficiency of British royals, slip past a few hundred young women and teen girls into black Escalades, their portal to the heart of the American mainstream.It's mid-November and BTS have flown here from South Korea, propelled by the fervor of their admirers, a diverse group that calls itself ARMY (short for ""Adorable Representative M.C for Youth""). The band is here for a string of high-profile TV appearances: They go from the airport to James Corden; Jimmy Kimmel the next day; then theyâ€™ll meet Ellen Degeneres, who'll compare their U.S. arrival to that of the Beatles in 1964. But BTS are mainly in town to perform their hit song ""DNA"" at the American Music Awards â€“ a performance that will make them Google's top trending topic and set a Guinness record for Twitter engagement.Group leader RM (short for ""Rap Monster""), 23 and palpably ambitious, compares the whirlwind trip to being ""like surfers on a big wave."" But at 9 a.m. the day after BTS land, the vibe is more like ""showing up for work."" We're at a rehearsal studio when AMA reps arrive to shoot promo photos in the parking lot. Bubbly ham J-Hope, 23, an MC and onetime street-dance champ, walks out with his arms up, shouting, ""Hello! AMA! Whoa!"" The others trickle out with less ado and take turns getting primped, on the asphalt, by a team of stylists also in from Seoul.There's Jimin, 22, the prettiest yet most puckish, a former top modern-dance student who's currently shaving his chin while a woman holds a mirror. The perpetually wide-eyed singer V, 21, another art-school kid, who made his screen debut in a Korean historical drama last year, gets his purple-gray bob brushed and parted. A man uses a pick to dislodge something from the teeth of Suga, who like RM started his career as an underground rapper. Lead singer Jungkook, 20, a devout Belieber who joined BTS at 15, gets a streak of eyeliner. Meanwhile, singer Jin, 25, an aspiring actor so handsome he was recruited by a boy-band casting agent while walking down the street, shuffles quietly through the flurry. Their entourage is massive; I lose count in the mid-thirties. There are managers, publicists, a choreographer, a masseur, the interpreter, groomers, folks with cameras, unsmiling guards and several drivers with earpieces.Back home, BTS are pretty much only breaking their own records at this point â€“ for video views, album pre-sales and chart placement â€“ and it's spilling over to other countries. Their recent EP, Love Yourself: Her,&nbsp;which features a song written with Andrew Taggart of the Chainsmokers, topped iTunes' album chart in 73 countries, and BTS have become the first Korean-pop group to crack the American mainstream, with a Steve Aoki remix of their ""MIC Drop"" recently crashing the Top 40.â€ª""We are so lucky that we're living in this time, in 2017,"" says RM, the only one who can carry on a conversation in English. ""When we post a tweet, it becomes translated to more than 30 languages."" The group's lyrics â€“ which are almost entirely Korean but close-captioned on YouTube and translated for sites like Genius â€“ are a big part of its international success. BTS songs tackle issues like depression and anxiety. They promote progressive social ideals like female empowerment and accepting people from different backgrounds. They even address the internal unease of ditching less commercial career paths to become ""idols,"" as K-pop stars are called.BTS fans appreciate the band's empathy, honesty, and independenceâ€”themes that are particularly in-demand amongst Western pop audiences these days.&nbsp;Plus, BTS set their message to canny hyper-modern production (frequently done by the members themselves) that devours all manner of EDM- rap- and R&amp;B-leaning pop â€“ think Major Lazer, Justin Bieber, DNCE, Logic, the Chainsmokers, Nick Jonas â€“ and spits out a deeply catchy, slightly askew pastiche.After the photoshoot, the guys go in to practice their AMAs routine. From the opening whistle of ""DNA,"" they are a single-minded, many-limbed organism. Jin, who normally seems like he's brooding, deploys pouty looks and precise hand jives. They goof around a bit â€“ Jimin grabs Jungkook's ass after the latter executes a balletic twirl â€“ but are in the zone. An hour later, at 10:40 a.m., they're chugging water and getting cooled off by women who use their entire bodies to swing paper fans emblazoned with the boys' own faces. Jin quickly nods off in a rolling chair but is soon awoken by the masseur, who wants to jam an elbow into his shoulder; Jin winces as he does. Minutes later, V is yowling in pain, mouth wide as a handler treats a canker sore inside his cheek. Later, RM will dance with a bloody tissue in his nose â€“ the wages of jet lag and constant hustle add up. An early lunch of cold burgers and fries seems meager compensation, but they eat with abandon. BTS, an acronym for Bangtan Boys (""Bulletproof Boy Scouts"" in Korean), was built around RM and finalized via auditions. The group was assembled by a small company â€“ Big Hit, run by songwriter ""Hitman"" Bang Si Hyuk, who co-founded one of the so-called Big Three agencies, JYP, before leaving it behind â€“ which gives them underdog appeal. And while BTS came through the famously rigorous K-pop system, living in dorms together and training constantly, RM says Big Hit offers relative artistic freedom. To wit, in a unique spin on K-pop fan service, BTS build mythologies around their albums, like last year's Wings, whose theme comes from Hermann Hesse's 1919 bildungsroman Demian. The concept appears in the lyrics, art and videos. Exactly how these subplots take shape is unclear, but it's feasible that RM, who reads heady authors like Haruki Murakami and Albert Camus, is involved.""We try to make our own BTS context,"" he says. ""Maybe it's risky to bring some inspiration from novels from so long ago, but I think it paid off more. It comes through like a gift box for our fans. That's something you can't find easily from American artists."" Instead, he likens it to Star Wars.""The big thing about creating our universe is expandability,"" adds Suga, the most contemplative of the group, via interpreter. ""Because it draws from our personal lives and interests, we can expand it as much as we want and it's not alien for us. Having that allows us more diversity in the stories we can tell and the music we can make.""Do they feel free enough to write about Korean politics? RM says they're working on a song that does so subtly, but Suga cautions that the subject ""is fraught with danger, not in a literal way, but because of the risk of being misunderstood by young people who may not have fully developed sensibilities."" He'd rather focus on fostering understanding than ""inciting conflict."" The rest of the group stays silent for our midday interview except to shout out ARMY and admit they're eager for more crossover opportunities. As J-Hope puts it, ""It'd be an honor for us to work with anyone.""RM says that, instead of breaking more records, the band's mission is to promote individuality, which isn't always encouraged back home. ""Especially in Korea, there are all these standards: Get married, go to a nice university."" How will they spread that message? He smiles. ""Better music and doper performances.""After selling out arenas in California, Chicago and New Jersey, BTS are planning a bigger U.S. run in 2018. They're in unprecedented territory. Unlike PSY, their success here didn't spring from a novelty hit â€“ their rise up American charts was gradual and shows no sign of slowing. While they've brushed off the idea of an English-language album in the past, RM dropped English verses on a Fall Out Boy remix and Wale collab this year.At 1:30 p.m., it's time to get ready for Kimmel. I follow BTS from the dance studio into the hall near their dressing room. There's a folding table covered with silver rings, flashy necklaces and dangly earrings for the choosing. On the floor is an outsize ziplock full of identical Puma slides. After hair is redone and outfits adjusted, they load into the four Escalades with no fuss at all.As our caravan passes Hollywood Boulevard and turns onto the small street leading to Kimmel's backlot and outdoor stage, we see them: more than a thousand BTS zealots who explode when they see us. They'd been waiting for hours. Kimmel music producer Mac Burrus later tells me a group of five teens spent two nights out there, on the street, in sleeping bags.In the green room, there is finally downtime. Suga and RM eat bananas. Jin plays his Nintendo Switch. Jungkook and J-Hope sleepily lean into one another on the couch. V lays on the floor to get his neck adjusted by the masseur's bone-crunching assassin-twist before settling into a sofa to stream ""Carpool Karaoke."" Around 4 p.m., producers bring in a couple ARMY moms for a skit where they taunt their girls, who are still in the line, via FaceTime from BTS' inner sanctum. The daughters eventually come back and I steal them for a chat. Both discovered BTS on YouTube. Adriana, 24, is teaching herself Korean ""slowly but surely"" so she can hear the boys in their own tongue. Rosa, 18, insists, ""Language isn't a barrier when it comes to music.""At 6:20 p.m., BTS head to the stage. From the back, it sounds like there's a roller coaster full of shrieking riders on the other side. A grizzled staffer walks by with a kooky grin, muttering, ""This is nuts."" From the wings I watch the band rip into a six-song set that inspires face-clutching and tears. For ""Save Me,"" a ""Where Are Ãœ Now"" soundalike, the crowd deploys a coordinated K-pop ""fanchant,"" roaring each member's birth name in perfect rhythmic succession. I can barely hear the music, so it doesn't occur to me until the end that BTS donâ€™t seem to be using vocal backing tracks, as a U.S. or U.K. group might â€“ they rap and sing every last part while doing constant choreography.When it ends just after 7 p.m., an exhausted J-Hope flops onto the asphalt out of view of the crowd and his team, chest heaving, eyes wide. After 30 seconds, he picks himself up and rushes to join the other members of BTS disappearing into the hall leading to the green room. As he turns the last corner, a voice squeals, ""Oh, my God! J-Hope looked back at me!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,Brittany Spanos,2018-02-14T15:52:00.000Z,How Michael and Janet Jackson Created the New Black Rock Star,"michael jackson beat it, janet jackson black cat",Rolling Stone,"In 1982, Michael Jackson wasn't yet Michael Jackson, megastar.&nbsp;Before Thriller, the thenâ€“24-year-old had released five solo albums but was still defining his own sound separate from the success of the Jackson 5. He had won his first Grammy for Off the Wall's ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" and begun a long and fruitful relationship with producer Quincy Jones. But he needed a boundary-breaking showstopper that could help make him a household name. For Jackson to forge an alliance with a beloved hard-rock guitar heavyweight on future smash ""Beat It"" was a major coup.""Eddie Van Halen was much more beloved in the MTV world than Michael Jackson,"" critic Greg Tate reflects. ""He was a bigger star than Michael Jackson.""For what would become one of Jackson's biggest hits, the pop star and Jones made one of the finest, and shrewdest, creative calls of their joint career: adding Van Halen and his instantly recognizable finger-tapping guitar-work to ""Beat It."" While Thriller was already a hit with the world, the release of the single â€“ which paired Jackson's steely R&amp;B vocals with a glitzy hair-metal edge â€“ helped solidify it as the biggest album of all time.""I wanted to write the type of rock song that I would go out and buy,"" Jackson said of the song. ""But also something totally different from the rock music I was hearing on Top 40 radio.""He achieved both. The success of Thriller was an obvious breakthrough for Jackson, but it also signified a tectonic shift for black artists and the loosening boundaries of pop music. MTV began playing the historic videos for ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It,"" helping to make it the youth hub of the Eighties and paving the way for more representation for black artists just before the explosion of hip-hop.By that time, rock had become inseparable from whiteness; the explosion of subgenres like punk and heavy metal had pulled rock further away from its roots in black music. Disco was a brief solace, a genre that saw both rock and pop heavyweights (including Jackson) exploring it in an effort to stay on top. With a song like ""Beat It,"" one that owed as much to metal as it did to R&amp;B, Jackson made room for the image of a new kind of black rock star, distinct from founding fathers like Chuck Berry&nbsp;and newly relevant for the Eighties.Guitarist Steve Stevens would work with Jackson on his following album, Bad, delivering a blistering solo on ""Dirty Diana."" It was another key hard-rock moment for Jackson, and certainly not his last.""Credit, really in the case of myself and Eddie Van Halen, [goes] to Ted Templeman, Van Halen's producer and my A&amp;R guy when I was signed to Warner Brothers,"" Stevens reminisces to Rolling Stone. At the time, Stevens was making a name for himself as Billy Idol's guitarist. ""Ted was friends with Quincy Jones, so when it came time after the success of 'Beat It,' the story that I got was Quincy called Ted and said 'OK, who is the hot new rock guitar player? We have another rock track on the Bad record.' And Ted suggested that Quincy call me.""In the studio for a session that didn't last much longer than three hours, Stevens met Jackson the Artist, as opposed to an entourage-laden megastar. Jackson and Jones let Stevens do what he wanted on the track's heavy solo, offering only a bit of guidance in terms of vision. It wasn't until they filmed the video that the guitarist got a sense of how much Jackson had become invested in rock.""He was preparing for his first major tour and up until that time, he had only toured with the Jackson 5,"" Stevens explains. ""He was adamant that he wanted a big arena-rock production, so he started asking me what sound company we use and what lighting company.""They even began exchanging music recommendations. ""One of the funniest things he asked: 'Hey, do you know MÃ¶tley CrÃ_e?'"" he quotes with a chuckle. ""He [also] did a spot-on impression of David Lee Roth for me. Now, if you could imagine how surreal that is â€“ Michael Jackson doing David Lee Roth.""Months later, Stevens joined Jackson to perform ""Dirty Diana"" at Madison Square Garden for an NAACP benefit and was able to witness firsthand the results of Jackson's meticulous tour planning. ""When I saw it, it was like a rock show,"" he recalls. ""The staging, lighting, everything was on that level, and I immediately thought 'Yeah, he gets it.' He wanted to appear big and larger than life.""Jennifer Batten, Jackson's touring guitarist, was in the thick of his rock-inspired show for three tours as well as the star's landmark 1993 Super Bowl halftime performance. Prior to her time with Jackson, Batten played everything from folk to funk. In the early Eighties, she lived in San Diego and worked with a cover band. They were in rehearsal when she first heard ""Beat It"" on the radio.""I'll never forget it,"" she tells RS. ""Everybody's jaws just dropped when the solo hit because it was so unusual and exotic for a pop tune. Usually, solos for pop tunes are very predictable and this was wild as hell.""Afterwards, she set out to memorize Van Halen's solo and ""failed three times"" because of all the new techniques. ""Eventually I nailed it, and boy did that pay off.""Batten spent two months in rehearsals with Jackson and the singers, band and dancers for the Bad tour. It was a ""playground"" for Jackson, according to the guitarist. The leather and metal of his attire at the time translated to the larger-than-life production â€“ one if its era's most tech-savvy and advanced tours. Batten remembers Jackson as a voracious listener with his finger on the pulse.""He listened to every kind of music, from classical to showtunes to metal,"" she explains. ""Metal has a certain power to it that Jackson was certainly intrigued with. Iâ€™m sure he also had marketing in mind when he linked up with Van Halen. It was an obvious crossover that brought him to an audience he wouldn't have gotten without that."" Just as hip-hop was ""black America's CNN,"" as Chuck D so incisively put it, hard rock, specifically heavy metal, had become the primary outlet for white male rage. So for Jackson, the squeaky-clean baby brother of the Jackson 5 whose most suggestive song prior to Thriller was the saccharine disco hit ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" the fusion which began with ""Beat It"" and continued with ""Dirty Diana"" was a major risk. At the time, mainstream black rockers were scarce; Prince's breakthrough 1999 would arrive around the same time as Thriller but he wouldn't realize his heavier rock potential until 1984's&nbsp;Purple Rain.Even though ""Beat It"" had paved the way, a similar musical move from Jackson's younger sister came as its own unique shock. In August 1990, Janet Jackson released ""Black Cat,"" the sixth single off her politically charged fourth solo album Rhythm Nation 1814. In the Eighties, she had struggled and ultimately succeeded in breaking free from her older brother's superstardom; she was a pop princess who became a queen with the trailblazing Control.&nbsp;She&nbsp; reaffirmed her power with Rhythm Nation and would spend the Nineties and early 2000s experimenting with R&amp;B and her own image. For a brief moment in 1990, however, Jackson was a metalhead. ""Black Cat"" remains one of her most vicious vocal moments, which finds her savagely screeching in a style that clearly departs from her past. The song went to Number One and earned a Grammy nod for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, making her the only artist in history to score nominations across five genres throughout her career. ""I was one of the few rock guitar players that I had known from Boston and the East Coast clubs we played when I was growing up that was obsessed with pop and dance music â€“ and Janet, of course,"" says Extreme's Nuno Bettencourt. Just before his band would explode with their own 1990 album Pornograffitti, he was brought into the studio to record rhythm guitar for the single version of ""Black Cat."" ""I listened to [Janet] nonstop,"" he says. ""My band thought I was crazy.""After his appearance on the song, Bettencourt says he got mixed reactions from his rock compatriots who weren't fully sold on Janet Jackson's hard-rock moment. He likened his situation to Van Halen's work on ""Beat It"" and how the rock world responded to his working with MJ.""It didn't quite bring the rock community over to Michael, yet,"" he says. ""It was kind of like a novelty on MTV. It was about the solo for the rock community and I don't think they quite got that it was a collaboration where both those worlds collided. With Janet, it was just another step towards that.""As a kid, Dave Navarro, who would re-record the guitar parts on ""Black Cat"" for Janet Jackson's Rock Witchu tour â€“ he even appeared as a screen projection during the live show â€“ felt empowered by the meeting of hard rock and pop that the Jacksons brought about. ""As a guitar player, I was a huge Van Halen fan â€“ both the band and Edward Van Halen as a guitar player,"" he reminisces. ""And then when Michael had Van Halen play on a track and it was massive, it really spoke to me and I found it to be really exciting that there was this cross-pollination happening with the genres like that.""Navarro would go on to play live with Michael Jackson at the Democratic National Convention in 2002, offering up a guitar solo on ""Black or White."" To him, these moments where genres and communities intersect are about much more than just the music.  ""There was a time when these genres were very exclusive to their fan bases and I think that in an overall sense â€“ I hate to get too spiritual about it â€“ but I think that putting something out there that's inclusive that all people can relate to was almost in its own way a movement of spiritual connectedness,"" he offers. ""Just because you're a kid whoâ€™s into guitar doesnâ€™t mean that what weâ€™re doing isn't for you.""Despite the advances made by the Jacksons, contemporary pop stars have often encountered friction when engaging with hard rock. When Rihanna paired up with Slash for 2009's edgy ""Rockstar 101,"" she was deep in the midst of a record-breaking hot streak of chart dominance. By the time BeyoncÃ© called up Jack White to join her on the Led Zeppelinâ€“sampling 2016 track ""Don't Hurt Yourself,"" she was already an icon. They didn't need a hard rock co-sign to get airplay or respect in the way Michael and Janet did, but that didn't make their cross-genre exploration any less of a hard sell to purists.""Doing five tours with Rihanna and stuff in the studio, I still remember I would be in Europe and get a call to do an interview with a guitar magazine or a rock magazine,"" Bettencourt recalls of his time touring with the singer. Possibly as an ode to her influence from Janet, the Barbadian pop star called up the Extreme guitarist for not only her live shows but a solo on the Anti&nbsp;track ""Kiss It Better.""During this time, he would ask journalists who would interview him before shows to stick around and see him perform with Rihanna. ""Probably nine out of times this happened ... they look at each other and say, 'Thanks so much, but it's not my cup of tea.' It was not belittling but was kind of like, 'Yeah that's cute.'""They didn't understand that it's music, and what you can do with the energy and the possibilities of what guitar can do. That's why [the music director] called me in the first place.""The reaction of rock connoisseurs to Rihanna working with a metal veteran mirrors the reactions to BeyoncÃ© being recognized in the Best Rock Performance category at the 2017 Grammys. Before the male and female distinctions were removed, it's the same category Michael Jackson took home an award for in 1984 for ""Beat It"" and that Janet Jackson's ""Black Cat"" had been nominated for back in 1991. ""Is it diverse? Absolutely. It's too diverse!"" Disturbed's David Draiman told Billboard about being up against the pop star in the Rock category that year. ""When you can have, with all due respect, a BeyoncÃ© and a Disturbed in the same category, something has gone wrong. Not taking anything away from her whatsoever, we're just very different from each other.""Draiman's complaints reflect larger issues with pop and hard rock: persistent arguments over authenticity, gatekeeping and lingering segregation. Heavy metal, and rock in general, is no longer the focal point of pop music, and the face of pop is beginning to reflect the utopian ideal of non-white superstars that the Jacksons' unprecedented success seemed to promise.""Hard rock as we know it is a white supremacist genre,"" critic Greg Tate says. And while black pop stars no longer need white rockers to help them achieve wider appeal, the borders of rock have become more closed than ever.&nbsp;""There's a dismissal of black artists' capability to be real rock &amp; rollers. It's just a reflection of America and the fear of people at the top being anything but white,"" Tate continues. ""They feel threatened and destabilized when successful black people make a move on their realm.""It's a perpetual hunt for the Great White Hope.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,David Browne,2017-10-27T20:27:00.000Z,"Remembering Fats Domino, 1928â€“2017","Little Richard, John Lennon, Robbie Robertson, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Blueberry Hill, fats domino tribute, fats domino dead, fats domino beatles",Rolling Stone,"Fats Domino was never a typical rock &amp; roll star. On the road, he packed a hot plate and packages of rice and beans so he could cook his favorite meals in hotels. He stayed married to the same woman for more than 60 years. And he downplayed rock &amp; roll's wild side. After riots broke out at two of his concerts in 1956, he told a reporter, ""I never would use dirty lyrics. And I don't use body movements either. I just play the piano, or I sing and clap my hands.""Yet Domino, who died on October 24th in Harvey, Louisiana, at age 89 of natural causes, was a quietly volcanic founding father of rock &amp; roll. His early classics like ""Blueberry Hill,"" ""I'm Walkin'â€‰"" and ""Ain't That a Shame"" featured an infectious blend of Dixieland rhythms, his charming, Creole-flecked voice, and what his peer Dion DiMucci calls ""the rolling sound of his fingers on the piano."" During the first wave of rock &amp; roll in the Fifties, he was second only to Elvis Presley in record sales. Domino was among the first acts inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986. During his induction speech, Billy Joel said, ""Traditionally, when people think of rock &amp; roll, they think of the guitar. I want to thank the man who proved that the piano was a rock &amp; roll instrument.""Domino's ebullient recordings went on to become standards; John Lennon once recalled hearing ""Ain't That a Shame"" as a teenager. ""It was the first song I could accompany myself on,"" he said in 1975. ""It has a lot of memories for me."" Bonnie Raitt says, ""Something about his voice was so engaging and sweet, and I loved the way his accent crept into his words. And when I saw photos of him, you couldn't not fall in love with him.""Born Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. on February 26th, 1928, Domino grew up in â€“ and never really left â€“ the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans. A fan of big-band swing, he was already gigging in local honky-tonks and bars by the time he was a teenager. At 14, he dropped out of high school, taking jobs like working at a bedspring factory as a way to supplement his music. He began playing piano in local bandleader Billy Diamond's band, where he earned the nickname ""Fats,"" partly in homage to piano predecessors like Fats Waller. At one of those gigs, he met jazz bandleader Dave Bartholomew and Imperial Records head Lew Chudd. Bartholomew's son Ron recalls his dad saying he ""knew Fats was a star â€“ even his diction, the way he pronounced words, was unique."" Domino signed a record deal that same night, and he and Bartholomew co-wrote 1949's ""The Fat Man"" â€“ a rewrite of a New Orleans standard â€“ which became an R&amp;B hit and one of the earliest rock &amp; roll records. It was the beginning of a long partnership, which often involved Bartholomew harnessing Domino's talent. ""Fats was much more playful, a fun type of guy,"" says Ron. ""But my dad would say, 'You're only as good as your next hit record.'â€‰"" The two teamed up again for 1955's ""Ain't That a Shame,"" a powerful song full of rhythmic punches and Domino's easy vocal charm. It became a national Top 10 hit. ""It don't have no bridge to it, no middle,"" Dave Bartholomew said. ""It's the same sentence over and over again. But we sold it with the music.""""He kept it very simple,"" the late Allen Toussaint told Rolling Stone in 2007. ""He would start a pattern right from the beginning and it would last throughout the song, so if you liked the first two bars, you would like everything. He never fixed what wasn't broken. Before Fats, people played triplets in the upper register, and it was a timid kind of sound. When Fats played triplets in the lower register, there was nothing timid about it. No way.""Almost immediately, there were imitators. Pat Boone recorded a remake of ""Ain't That a Shame,"" which Keith Richards called ""so shallow and produced, and Fats' was just so natural."" Still, Boone's version received more airplay. The incident was just one example of the racism Domino experienced throughout his career. In the Fifties, his group often had to drive hours before finding a hotel that would accept black customers. When Domino attended the premiere of 1956's The Girl Can't Help It, the highly influential early rock film he appeared in, he wasn't allowed to sit with the other VIPs. ""He's the star of the film, and he had to sit upstairs at the premiere!"" said Joe Lauro, who directed 2016's Fats Domino and the Birth of Rock &amp; Roll. Domino didn't complain about those injustices, at least publicly. ""I just stick to my music,"" he said in 1968, when asked about the civil-rights movement.Domino's signature hit was 1956's ""Blueberry Hill,"" a remake of a song first cut by Gene Autry. ""Fats was the perfect cat to do 'Blueberry Hill,'â€‰"" says Jerry Lee Lewis. ""His vocals were phenomenal, and he was a great pianist â€“ he had the best raw talent."" Lewis, like his fellow rock &amp; roll innovators, envied Domino's swagger: ""He had a huge entourage. We talked cars all the time, and we both loved Rolls-Royces. Jewelry, nice suits â€“ we had a lot of similar interests, come to think of it.""""He influenced me as an entertainer, period,"" says Little Richard. ""When I was a boy in Macon, Georgia, Fats used to come there. I didn't have the money to go see him, so I used to try and sneak in, because I loved him. He was just a little, short guy with little-bitty hands, and he could make a piano talk.""Domino's last Top 10 hit, ""Walking to New Orleans,"" came in 1960, and his career slowed down. But soon, a new generation of artists began touting him as an influence. Paul McCartney channeled his style for ""Lady Madonna""; Randy Newman arranged the horns for Domino's 1969 cover of Newman's ""Have You Seen My Baby?"" The Band paid homage with a cover of ""I'm Ready"" for 1973's Moondog Matinee; Robbie Robertson remembers seeing him live as a 14-year-old: ""He wore a pink suit and had a smile as wide as his piano. When he kicked into 'I'm Walkin',' he set the place on fire, and I couldn't breathe. The sound, the groove, the power coming from this five-foot-five bundle of rollicking New Orleans joy killed.""In the Sixties and Seventies, while Chuck Berry experimented with psychedelia and Jerry Lee went country, Domino never changed his sound. That also applied to his live shows: ""Fats made sure those arrangements were played,"" said Lauro. ""He did not take a pickup band on the road. When you saw Fats Domino, until the last show, you could close your eyes and it would be like being in a joint in 1955. It was ageless.""The responsibility of keeping that large touring operation together led Domino to retire in 1996. He made headlines in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina obliterated his neighborhood. Domino was reported missing for days until he and his family were rescued on his roof. Though his home was destroyed, Domino was typically nonchalant about it. ""I ain't missin' nothin',"" he said afterward. ""Just one thing that happened, I guess.""After Katrina, Domino started working again. In 2006, he released Alive and Kickin', which became one of his most acclaimed works. Rolling Stone caught up with him around that time at his new home. Still dapper in captain's hat and patent-leather shoes, he showed writer Charles M. Young how he would cook red beans in his bathroom, so he didn't make a mess for his wife, Rosemary. He was also still playing down his accomplishments. Asked about the often riotous response he received in concert, he said, ""It wasn't anything in the music, so it must have been something in the audience.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,Dan Hyman,2018-01-11T20:34:21.946Z,Ralph Steadman: Legendary 'Fear and Loathing' Illustrator Talks Making First Rap Album Art,"Ralph Steadman, Huncho Jack, Travis Scott, Huncho Jack art, Quavo",Rolling Stone,"""I certainly don't keep up with hip-hop but I'm trying to now,"" says iconic British illustrator and painter Ralph Steadman, best known as the twisted mind behind the dark, grotesque, hilarious, disturbing art that accompanied the early-1970s gonzo journalistic screeds of the late Hunter S. Thompson, including his 1972 novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and various Rolling Stone covers.What made Steadman, 81, decide to expand his musical horizons? In early December he was enlisted to draw the cover art for Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, the debut album from Huncho Jack, the hip-hop duo of Travis Scott and Quavo of Migos. ""I listened to their music, realized the energy in their performances and translated that performance visually,"" Steadman says of the project, which he completed in less than a week's time. When the rappers saw his completed work â€“ a demented, slightly sinister portrait of the pair, flanked by cacti, crows and bats, all in the artist's signature scribble â€“ they told him over the phone, ""It's a vibe."" Steadman, not one to keep up with the latest in hip-hop vernacular, admits he had no idea what they were talking about. But, as he notes with a laugh, ""I said, 'OK. I must have caught the vibes a bit then, I guess.'""Before taking on the Huncho Jack project, Steadman had never listened to either of the rappers' music. ""That's the weird part about it,"" he says. ""They came out of nowhere to me. I'd never heard of them. The rapper culture wasn't familiar to me. And apparently they're big in America. Aren't they associated with the Kardashian family or something?"" He learned they were fans of his Fear and Loathing work, as well as drawings of his that had appeared in the pages of Rolling Stone. ""They sent me sort of photocopies of lots of my pictures from Rolling Stone and Fear and Loathing and all that stuff,"" Steadman recalls. ""I sensed that they had picked up on my drawings with Hunter Thompson. I also sensed that they wanted portraits in the gonzo manner. They liked cactus plants, bats as well, and parallel lines, like the desert scenes from the Las Vegas drawings."" Ultimately, Steadman explains, it was the rappers' dreadlocks that drew him in. ""I felt like, oh, this is interesting. Most of my friends haven't gotten any hair anymore,"" he laughs. ""I just really thought they were quite funny. And I wondered what I could do with them or how I could draw them. And I just did it in the best way I could.""Steadman's association with contemporary music ""makes me feel old,"" he offers. ""But I was flattered that they should even bother in thinking that was the thing they wanted. It's kind of nice. It's really a compliment â€“ and particularly in the musical world where all sorts of new things are happening."" Right now, however, if there's one thing that's continually holding the attention of the man who drew a decaying Nixon on a 1973 Rolling Stone cover, it's President Donald Trump. ""It's just so shocking and so terrible â€“ the shock and horror,"" he says of our commander-in-chief. Despite not living in the United States, ""we're all to blame,"" he says. ""He must have aged a lot of people."" Some of Steadman's most famous works were overtly political so it's hardly a surprise to learn he's drawn Trump several times in the past year. In addition to depicting Trump as a baby ""shitting out the American flag""' for his ""Porky Pie"" drawing for The New Statesman, as well as posting on his Instagram an image of Trump decapitating the Statue of Liberty, with the caption ""Statue of Liberty takers,"" Steadman reveals he's also drawn Trump as Trumpelstiltskin. ""I don't think he cares about anyone,"" the artists says of the President. ""His wife's a trophy and she looks as if she's been caught in the headlights.""When asked what Thompson would have made of Trump, Steadman can only laugh. ""Jesus, he would have gone after him, I think. I cannot imagine what he would have thought of him. I wish he'd stayed around for this. It would have been great. That would have been something. He really could bring a President down.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,Sarah  Grant,2017-11-03T20:37:00.000Z,Inside Jesse Paris Smith's Bold New Plan to Fight Trump and Save the Planet,"pathway to paris, patti smith, michael stipe, jesse paris smith, carnegie hall events, carnegie hall pathway to paris, climate change events, UNDP, 350 org,",Rolling Stone,"Jesse Paris Smith remembers the exact day she became a climate activist. Late on a school night, in a Manhattan deli, frantically skimming the New York Times to finish a last-minute homework assignment in 10th grade. ""I loved nature, so these words like global warming, greenhouse gases, fossil fuels struck me,"" Smith, 30, says while sitting in a Midtown Manhattan conference room. Smith is warm and unimposing. She smiles when she speaks so her eyes are like little brown crescents framed by her plum knit cap.&nbsp;Back at home, Smith continues, she messaged the one still-awake person on AOL Instant Messenger to see if he knew anything of these intriguingly named concepts. ""It was terrible,"" she said flatly. ""It felt like I was dealing with the end of the world and nobody was talking about it.""That genuine fear she felt as a teenager was also a call to action that she's developed as an adult. In 2014, Smith founded the nonprofit organization,&nbsp;Pathway to Paris, which hosts inventive events where a hodgepodge of artists, academics, politicians and scientists gather to talk about environmental rights. Smith â€“ daughter of Patti Smith and the late&nbsp;Fred ""Sonic"" Smith â€“ connected with co-organizer, the cellist Rebecca Foon, before the People's Climate March the same year.&nbsp;High-profile artists like Thurston Moore, Michael Stipe and Thom Yorke became regulars, drawn to Pathway's message and its clubhouse-like vibe. Last summer, for example, Smith threw a Pathway fundraiser/200th birthday party for her favorite poet, Henry David Thoreau, in an intimate wine bar. Stipe read the great transcendental work, ""My Love Must Be As Free"" for the occasion.&nbsp;But in the dark aftermath of the 2016 election and&nbsp;President Trump's abrupt decision to pull the United States out of the global Paris Agreement, Smith and Foon concocted Pathway's most impactful idea: 1,000 Cities. Starting this year, the new initiative will provide funding and awareness to help cities become completely carbon-neutral by 2040. As part of a new climate-fighting triptych with the United Nations Development Programme and grassroots group 350.org, Smith is energized by the new solution-oriented direction. On Sunday at Carnegie Hall, Pathway's Smith, Foon, Stipe and&nbsp;Patti Smith will be joined by a cadre of eclectic names including Joan Baez, 350.org founder Bill McKibben, Cat Power, Dr. Vandana Shiva, Talib Kweli and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to begin the vital new chapter.&nbsp;How has the feeling around Pathway to Paris intensified since Trump got elected?It's still horrible, but if there had to be a silver lining [to Trump's presidency] it's that it ignited a whole new wave of action. After the election, everyone who lives in my neighborhood â€“ we all gathered at this same place â€“ and in the morning everyone came in like a zombie. It disturbed me to see how upset and angry and how totally beaten down everyone was. Something snapped in me, where I was like, 'We can't sit around â€“ this is more urgent than it was before.' And, of course, it was already urgent.And now, without Obama, we've got something to lose.&nbsp;Yeah. And it's good to talk, but we can't just sit around complaining about how terrible it is. That just normalizes [these issues] into becoming a conversation piece.&nbsp;After Trump, so many of us felt sad, heartbroken, we felt sick, anxious and worried. We have to turn those feelings into action. Instead of dwelling forever in the darkness, we need to turn towards solutions, and ask ourselves and each other, 'So how do we fix it? What do we do?' That's what helps me to cope. Even if you don't know what impact something will have, doing something, anything, any act big or small feels better than sitting at home and living in this miserable, lonely panic.&nbsp;Turning our angry feelings into positive action and working together, finding each other, finding others who feel the same, is the best work we can do.&nbsp;What was your reaction to the business community and politicians pledging to uphold their emissions targets despite Trump backing out of the Paris Agreement?I felt a whole new wave of citizen uprising; a new voice of citizen activism. The day Trump pulled out of the agreement, you saw people talking who weren't talking before. They weren't talking a year or even five years before that. Pathway to Paris had been going on since 2014, but it was still tough to get people to listen, come to our events and join the movement. Now it's really easy. Even with my own friends, there was a big spike. I feel like saying, 'Guys, I've been here doing this for 15 years!'Sometimes unfortunately it takes terrible news, tragic events, and scary people in power to ignite people to action. People often don't join a movement until it affects them personally. My mom said recently, 'let's hope the whole world doesn't wait to join the climate movement until every person becomes personally effected.'&nbsp;Climate change is the most critical issue of our time, it affects every living being, every person on earth and the Earth is our collective home.&nbsp;How do you envision a 100 percent renewables-based city?It's almost a metaphorical idea. Because what that looks like for New York City would be different from how it would be in New Delhi, which would be different from Tokyo. It's fun to imagine how, as we went into the industrial revolution, we can also go into this new era of renewable energy. It could be a brand new era of our world.How will you measure the progress of partnering cities as they work on becoming more carbon neutral?One thing we're using is a free Creative Commons tool called City Insight. It basically inputs all the data of a city â€“ all its GHG emissions from all sectors â€“ to help create a climate plan in order to reduce emissions by 100% by 2040. That's what they used with Toronto â€“ a 1,000 Cities partner â€“ and it was successful. Our other hope is to create a network for cities get funding to help implement their plans. And then the music and the concert aspect of [Pathway to Paris] is there to keep the issue in the culture, where people feel connected and can get involved.The individuals you gather for Pathway events are increasingly eclectic â€“ Bill McKibben to Michael Stipe. Why that approach?What we noticed was that it felt like there was a gap, that there wasn't a strong or wide reaching cultural voice in the climate movement. I think that is why groups like 350.org, and speakers like Bill McKibben were excited to get involved with us. On the other side, [musicians like] Michael Stipe were excited, too. I really love the mutual admiration of the events. When the [United Nations Development Programme] got involved, they would say things like, 'Oh, no one wants to hear from all these speakers, we need more music.' On the flip side, the musicians said things like, 'We have too much music. Let's get one more speaker!'You're only 30, and in addition to Pathway to Paris, you've curated unique music and arts events at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Rubin Museum and the annual Tibet House fundraiser. Where do you think your desire to curate came from?I would go on tour with my mom and her band during the summers when I was a teenager, and looking for a role to have, I became an assistant to her tour manager. I really liked the behind-the-scenes stuff. Setting up the stage, checking microphones, printing things, calling everyone to tell them what time they're getting picked up in the morning. Whereas my brother's a guitar player and he would go and play with her. I was more interested in the behind the scenes work, maybe from putting on musicals in middle school and high schoolAnd you were like, what, 14?&nbsp;Yes, 14, 15,16 [laughs]. I loved playing music and I wanted to take piano lessons when I was 13, but I always thought of music more as my own private hobby.&nbsp;When was the first time you performed with your mom onstage?I was 16. We played ""Imagine"" for John Lennon's birthday at the Free Library in Philadelphia.Were you nervous?Terrified [laughs].&nbsp;I didn't have any experience performing, and then I had to go onstage with this band that had been playing together for like 30 years! I didn't tell anyone I was nervous, I just thought to myself, 'they need me to do this. Just be cool, don't mess up.' [Laughs]It's like what you were saying about poetry â€“ how it's a lot easier to get up onstage when you're reading a poem as opposed to singing a song.That's how I learned to compose music â€“ writing music for my mom to read poetry to. She would give me a poem or a piece of writing to read at an event, or to be recorded. So together, we would look at the poem, thinking through its movements, 'what is the feeling of this poem? What changes are there? Is this hopeful, is it sad, dark, is it peaceful? I would go through and diagram what lines or parts sounded intense, solemn, or maybe required something else that was different, interesting.&nbsp;It taught me so much about how while we need some technical understanding and skills, music is about feeling, emotion, intuition, something that is expressed without words. You hear the music and without needing to be told, or have it explained to you, the feelings are all there. What's your earliest memory of feeling a connection to nature?Well, I was born in Detroit and grew up in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, which is a little town on the lake on Lake St. Clair. Our area of town was called the Nautical Mile. Behind and in between all the houses were canals leading up to the lake at the end of our dead end street. There were tons of kids in our neighborhood, so we would get home from school every day and go on an adventure. Growing up there I was fully immersed in nature every day.Did you have a boat?No, but some friends did. We'd go fishing on our deck for â€“ muskies? Yes [laughs] â€“ I think that's what they're called. You'd have to ask my brother. Where we lived was filled with shops selling all kinds of lures. There was a bait shop, a marina, a supply store for sailing clothes and souvenir shops selling little sailboats and lighthouses. We moved to Manhattan when I was nine. It was an intense transition. I don't know if I'd have the same love of nature if I was born in Manhattan.Why do you think you think climate change had such a strong impact on you?It felt I was dealing with the end of the world and nobody was talking about it. When I was 15, I said okay, I have to become a climate scientist! And I'm gonna have a science lab and live on the glaciers and study the ice melting! [Laughs].&nbsp;I started to volunteer for different environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Environmental Defense. When I was a teenager, I was a little shy, a little awkward. I didn't really know how to find other people who felt the same way as I did. So every night I'd go on my computer and sign petitions, write letters to the mayor for hours by myself.&nbsp;That's amazing.I remember there was a section on the Environmental Defense's global warming campaign website called ""Undoit.org"" where you could download all the materials to start your own local chapter. I downloaded all of the brochures and signup sheets and posters. I went to Kinkos and made copies, I had a filing system, clipboards, pens â€“ I was so excited about starting my own chapter!&nbsp;But then this fear set in. And I was too afraid to find anyone. I was even afraid to hang up a poster. I went out one day to hang them up and I just remember thinking 'I can't do this.' I still have the box with all of those materials. I didn't even tell my friends at school about it.What was holding you back?I was just so solitary and quiet. But being an activist and having a nonprofit is all about bringing people together and collaborating,&nbsp;just like being a performer and a musician. The older I got, the more I learned that and became more comfortable, and realized that finding each other and working together is what we absolutely need to do. There isn't time to be fearful or worried, or have doubts about reaching out. Whenever young people ask me for advice about how to get involved, I always tell them, 'don't be afraid to find your people, to find each other, and work together.'What did you do after high school?&nbsp;I was determined to be a climate scientist, even though I wasn't particularly good at math or science [laughs]. But I was also torn between pursuing science and music. It felt like choosing between what was in my heart and what came more naturally. So I deferred my acceptance to Sarah Lawrence College to figure out how I might do both. I applied to Columbia University â€“ they have this incredible climate program â€“ but got rejected. I was also in my first band at the time and I thought, I'll forget being a scientist and I'll work on music instead. But I kept going back and forth.I took courses at the New School about environmental writing. I also worked in a book bindery on 27th Street, and I loved binding books so much. Those experiences physically making books reminded me of how much I loved writing, and how much I wanted to write a book. I felt drawn to so many vocations, wanting to follow different paths, and I was just trying to figure it out. My mom inspired some of that, too.Because you saw it was possible to do more than one thing?&nbsp;She's singer, a songwriter, a writer, a poet, a photographer, an artist.&nbsp;So many people throughout history that I admire are polymaths, people who follow different paths, have many vocations, express themselves in different ways, and use their energy in more that one way. I also very much admire people who are masters of their crafts, but that isn't the path for every person. You can choose more than one path.Do you see the 1,000 Cities initiative becoming bigger than Pathway?Definitely. My hope is that Pathway to Paris continues to bring that cultural aspect and becomes a global event, where people in different cities can organize their own Pathway concerts as a way to bring people together around this issue.To participate or find out more about Pathway to Paris' 1,000 Cities initiative,&nbsp;sign up here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,Jonah Weiner,2018-02-23T13:52:25.218Z,Dua Lipa: Pop's Warrior of Love,"dua lipa, dua lipa new rules, dua lipa max martin ",Rolling Stone,"Some dudes on Saturday Night Live's crew are hammering together a green screen at Studio 8H when Dua Lipa walks past them in a long black dress, steps onto a stage, and seats herself atop a grand piano, dangling her legs from the end like a lounge act. It's the first Thursday in February, and two days from now, Lipa will take this stage as the evening's musical guest. She has reason to feel confident: A 22-year-old pop singer from London, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the U.K. last year; fans include Coldplay's Chris Martin and Bruno Mars; and her biggest single, ""New Rules,"" has more than a billion YouTube views. Lipa starts into ""Homesick,"" a wounded ballad she wrote with Martin, which is far and away the sparest song in her catalog â€“ a slow, spotlit showcase for her rich, smoky voice, whereas most of her songs tend toward brash, uptempo thumpers. Lipa's day-to-day manager, Jules, aims his phone at a monitor, shooting video of the rehearsal for reference, because Lipa's plan is to sit on the piano near-motionless for the entire song, and although she hopes this will register as subtly powerful, she also worries it might just come off as inert. Lipa has learned that, when you're in the public eye, even the tiniest gestures can resonate. For instance: Last October, she borrowed a Taylor Swift Speak Now T-shirt from Jules and wore it to a soundcheck and meet-and-greet in Germany. Photos made it to Instagram, and Swift's fans spotted it and giddily circulated the shots. Soon Swift herself posted a euphoric comment online in response: ""I AM SCREECHING WITH JOY."" The next month, however, all her goodwill with Team Taylor went up in flames when some of those same Swift fans discovered a 2016 video interview in which Lipa, engaged in a cats-or-dogs-style quiz, was asked to choose between Swift and Kanye West â€“ and went with Yeezy, emphatically and unhesitatingly. ""I wasn't thinking about their beef,"" she says. ""I was thinking about their music, and Taylor is amazing, but I'm such a hip-hop fan that I would probably choose Kanye over anyone."" The result was a barrage of hate from the Swift faithful. ""They were sending me snake emojis for, like, three days straight. They're like, 'I hope you die.' I'm like, 'Yo! I literally didn't say anything.'â€‰""Now, rehearsing at SNL, Lipa's worries about ""Homesick"" turn out to have merit. Legs crossed tight, back straight, she holds a cordless mic with her left hand and plants her right hand stiffly on the piano, not because it's what feels the most natural, necessarily, but because her vocal coach, Lorna, told her that this pose would help give her strength to catapult into the song's early, hard-to-hit high notes. The performance feels off, and, when it's over, Lipa grimaces: One particularly high note proved irksomely out of her reach. Within seconds, she's in a huddle with her team. Jules presses play on the video he shot; Lorna launches into vocal drills. Lipa scrutinizes the phone and makes strange noises for Lorna, then the SNL camera crew is back in position and it's time for another go. This time, when the second verse starts, Lipa clutches the mic two-handed, holds it to her chest, then brings her left palm up beside her cheek, where, captured in close-up, it trembles and grabs, helping to put some more drama into the performance. It's a minuscule tweak, but Lipa could tell from Jules' video that it would make a big difference. (Come Saturday, she will repeat these motions almost exactly.) Some three dozen crew members and assorted hangers-on watch, rapt. When she's done, the room breaks into applause. Looking effortless takes work.&nbsp;Dua Lipa hasn't performed for a room this small in a while. Last fall, she played two nights at Madison Square Garden while opening a bunch of arena shows for Bruno Mars. She has a sound suited to vast spaces: big beats, big hooks and even bigger vocals. She started posting YouTube covers from a friend's bedroom when she was 15, and even then she was unafraid to tackle full-throated material from heroes like Christina Aguilera and Joss Stone. These covers were part of a conscious strategy: ""It was like a portfolio. I would go out to gigs and make friends, and if someone was like, 'I'm a producer' or 'I'm a songwriter,' I'd be like, 'Well, I have these covers. ...'â€‰""A string of such encounters, in person and online, led her to Ben Mawson, a music manager whose client roster includes Lana Del Rey. He signed her, and ""literally the day after"" booked her into the studio with what would become a parade of various writers. Lipa said she did have a rough notion of what she wanted to sound like, inspired by her twinned loves of pop and hip-hop, but its oddness would throw people for a loop: ""I'd go into the studio, like, 'I want to sound like Nelly Furtado and J. Cole,' and people would be like, 'What the fuck?'â€‰"" Inspiration came from unlikely places. While co-writing with the London-based electronic act RITUAL, Lipa struggled to crack the code of an unfinished track: ""I was going through a tough breakup. Someone who made me feel like I wasn't good enough. But when I wrote this song, I wanted it to seem like he couldn't get enough of me."" The song ""was good, but the chorus wasn't quite there. We were like, 'Let's scrap it.' And I was scrolling through Tumblr, and I see the words 'Hotter than Hell' in red on a black background. And I go, 'That's cool!' What if he thought I was hotter than hell, and I just didn't want him?"" The single, ""Hotter Than Hell,"" went gold in the U.K. With that song, Lipa says she finally found a track that felt uniquely like her. It introduced her to fans as a sort of warrior of love: Moments of vulnerability and longing dot her lyrics, but her prevailing mode is to take no bullshit and take no prisoners. ""New Rules"" is framed as a three-point battle plan for cutting off a bad-news dude; a more recent single, ""IDGAF,"" plays almost like the sequel, where a former romantic tormentor crawls out of the woodwork, interested in rekindling things, and Lipa mercilessly sends him packing. These songs aren't exactly autobiographical, but Lipa says she's got ample experience in the chump-boyfriend department. Sometimes her exes were ""emotionally manipulative""; sometimes their failings were more comical. ""I dated this guy who literally would never eat a single vegetable,"" she recalls. ""I was like, 'This is terrible. You eat like a five-year-old. I'm fucking out.'â€‰""A couple of weeks ago, Lipa was watching the Grammys, blown away by Kendrick Lamar's performance. The event was criticized for the preposterous facts that Alessia Cara was the only woman to win an award during the entire show and that Lorde hadn't been offered a solo performance despite an Album of the Year nomination. Recording Academy president Neil Portnow dug the hole deeper when he remarked on this disparity by telling women music-makers to ""step up."" Lipa's eyes go wide discussing this. ""Women are stepping up,"" she says. ""We just need to be given a chance."" (Portnow later apologized for his wording.) She shakes her head. ""These men in power should be supporting everything that's happening, supporting equality, rather than saying, 'You're just not working hard enough.'â€‰""Lipa says that, growing up, she learned firsthand what work means. Born in London, she comes from a family of Albanians from Kosovo who left their homeland when it became engulfed in conflict. Her parents were immigrant strivers who ""worked in, like, restaurants and bars and little coffee shops,"" she says, making ends meet as London transplants. ""They worked really, really hard, and while they were doing that, my dad went to night school to get a business degree, then a master's in journalism, then started getting into advertising. My mom was getting her law degree before the war started, and when we moved to London she studied travel and tourism."" Music filled the Lipa household thanks to her father, who sang lead, on the side, in a Kosovar rock band called Oda. ""They did it for fun,"" she says, ""but then they had a really big song called 'Beso ne Diell,' which means 'Believe in the sun.' I did a show in Kosovo two summers ago and me and my band decided to surprise my dad and sing it. It was so surreal, because everyone in the audience was singing along."" In her early adolescence, the Lipas moved back to Kosovo's capital, Pristina: ""I could speak the language, but I couldn't read or write, so moving there was daunting â€“ the other kids weren't going to be making spelling mistakes on their homework. Not only that, but just being the new girl in school, once everyone has formed their friendships. It was nerve-wracking."" But she made friends, and they put her on to hip-hop. Her first concert was Method Man and Redman. Second was 50 Cent.At 15, intent on taking a shot at a music career, Lipa convinced her parents to let her move back to London without them, staying with a family friend and enrolling at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, whose alumni include Amy Winehouse and Rita Ora. A few years later, ""it came to the point where I had to decide what I wanted to do for university, and I didn't know,"" Lipa says. ""I knew the only thing I wanted to do was music. So I was like, 'Let me just take a year out and see what happens.'â€‰"" Before that year was through, she'd landed her major-label deal.When she's done rehearsing at SNL, Lipa gets into the back of a car and heads to her hotel, on the Lower East Side. Paparazzi have been waiting for her here on and off, but none are in sight at the moment. We try to grab a table at the hotel restaurant, but they don't open for another half-hour. We stand in the lobby, plotting our next move.Downtime is rare for Lipa these days. A few nights ago, she was up in Montreal for a headlining concert. Not long before that, she was in Jamaica, at the venerable Geejam Studios, hashing out songs for her next album. ""I want it to still be pop, but lean more toward soulful,"" she says of the project. ""My voice kind of lends itself to that genre."" She lists some of the things she's been drawing on for inspiration: ""Electric Chair,"" by Prince; the new Francis and the Lights album; a lot of Outkast. She's put in time in the studio in recent months with platinum-certified hitmakers like Mark Ronson and pop mastermind Max Martin. ""I spent a week with Max, and it was the first time where I felt like there was a lot more method to the things I was writing about. First with him you lay down the melodies, listen to them over and over again, and say, 'Maybe we should change this note.'â€‰"" When it came to writing lyrics, ""You couldn't use the same words too often, next to each other. And not everything can start on the one, because it doesn't keep it as interesting. I played him some of the stuff I did in Jamaica, and he'd say, 'You could totally simplify this. Just repeat that twice. Make it easier for the listener.' He has, like, a lot of rules and theories.""That sort of systematic approach appeals to Lipa, who keeps dozens of running lists on her phone, which she pulls out to show me: ""This is, like, the 100 books I should read before I die. I bought all of them, and my goal is to read them all."" She just finished Emma Cline's Manson-murders-inspired The Girls and loved it. Now she's in the middle of The Unbearable Lightness of Being. ""I think it helps with my songwriting,"" she says.There's still time to kill before the restaurant will seat us. ""Are you opposed to eating dessert before you eat dinner?"" she asks. We walk down the block to an ice cream parlor. ""This is, like, the third day in a row I've come here,"" she notes, digging a spoon into a cup of vegan vanilla something-or-other. ""I don't want to ruin my appetite,"" she says. ""But sometimes you've got to break the rules.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,Dan Hyman,2017-11-21T18:57:00.000Z,King Krule: Rock's Coolest New Crank Sounds Off,"king krule, king krule interview, king krule rolling stone, king krule the ooz, archy marshall, archy marshall interview",Rolling Stone,"The kids outside Chicago's Metro have been waiting for hours to see Archy Marshall, the 23-year-old London singer known as King Krule. But Marshall, who has a cold, is having a hard time getting excited about the sold-out show. ""I love playing music,"" he says. ""But especially on days like today, where my throat feels like shit, I dunno."" Marshall's blasÃ© attitude extends to pretty much everything, including celebrity endorsements. When Kanye West invited him to make music after hearing his 2013 breakthrough, Six Feet Beneath the Moon, Marshall says, he declined because he didn't want the pressure. BeyoncÃ© shared his spare, angsty 2013 single ""Easy Easy"" on social media. Today, Marshall says he's still skeptical of her praise. ""I'm not going to lie to you,"" Marshall says. ""I don't think BeyoncÃ© ever contacted me personally or ever complimented me from her own brain. I think it was something her social media team did. I haven't met her. She hasn't gone out to a gig. So how true is this shit?"" Marshall's ability to spin murky tales of disaffected working-class urban youth has made him something of an underground cult hero. His new LP, The Ooz, veers from jazz to punk to dub and hip-hop, with Marshall singing about everything from class warfare to depression in his gruff, preternaturally low growl. The schizophrenic arrangements make sense when Marshall starts talking about his childhood: A portrait of Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti hung in his home, and he was listening to underground jazz and reggae artists like Albert Ayler and Augustus Pablo, respectively. By 11, Marshall was recording on an 8-track. From then on, he says, ""I was always in my own world, creating."" He missed so much school that social services at one point threatened his parents with jail time; Marshall's luck turned around at 14 when he was accepted into the famed BRIT School, whose alumni include Adele and Amy Winehouse. ""That school saved me,"" he says. He began posting music on Bandcamp as Zoo Kid. Dean Bein, president of Marshall's label, True Panther, stumbled onto the bleak, folky ""Out Getting Ribs,"" and in 2011 released the then-17-year-old's debut EP as King Krule. Six Feet followed and was nominated for the BBC's album of the year.&nbsp;Marshall says his teenage success ""empowered me. I was like, 'Yeah, I always knew I was a genius. Now people know.'â€‰"" The success encouraged him to indulge in his wildest artistic fantasies on The Ooz, which features his eccentric observations amid manic fits of guitar and lounge-singer piano.Backstage after an intense performance, Marshallgreets guests like Chance the Rapper's band and SZA's producer Carter Lang, whobrings up the possibility of a collaboration between Krule and the R&amp;Bsinger. Marshall listens before excusing himself to his dressing room to rollup a cigarette. His mood seems to be brightening; asked to offer a take ontonight's show, he flashes a rare smile. ""Eh,"" he says. ""It wasall right.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,Al Shipley,2017-12-15T16:30:00.000Z,Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic': 10 Things You Didn't Know,"dr dre, dr dre chronic, the chronic, snoop chronic, snoop dre, dre the doc, the doc rapper, the doc accident, dr dre suge knight",Rolling Stone,"Although Dr. Dre had already helped put L.A. gangsta rap on the map as a member of N.W.A, it was his solo debut, released in December 1992, that made the good doctor a household name and turned Death Row Records into a hit factory. The Chronic introduced the world to stars like Snoop Doggy Dogg, Nate Dogg and Lady of Rage, sold millions, and settled scores with foes like Eazy-E and Luther Campbell. But it was Dre's groundbreaking production and string of hit singles that made The Chronic one of rap's most revered LPs, ranking at number 138 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. To celebrate the album's 25th anniversary, here are some things you may not know about The Chronic.1. The Chronic's low end was inspired by A Tribe Called Quest.To fans in the early Nineties, Dr. Dre's West Coast gangsta-rap movement and the East Coast's insurgent conscious-rap collective Native Tongues may have seemed to exist in direct opposition. But it turns out that Dre and A Tribe Called Quest shared a mutual admiration that spurred both of them to make landmark albums. Tribe's jazzy sophomore album The Low End Theory directly influenced Dre's development of The Chronic's rich, bass-heavy G-funk sound. ""It was listening to N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton that inspired us to make The Low End Theory,"" Q-Tip said in an MTV News interview. ""And years later I spoke to Dr. Dre and he told me that hearing The Low End Theory inspired him to make The Chronic.""2. Multiple major labels passed on The Chronic. Dr. Dre recorded The Chronic without a distribution deal in place for the newly formed Death Row Records, and then shopped the completed album, cover art and all, to multiple major labels. But even coming off the chart-topping success of N.W.A's swan song EFIL4ZAGGIN, labels were shy about paying Death Row's asking price, taking on Dre's legal issues with Ruthless Records, or releasing a gangsta-rap album at the height of media hysteria about explicit lyrics. Sony came close to releasing The Chronic, but after that deal fell through, Death Row and Interscope secured distribution through Priority, and began building an empire.3. A song was removed in the wake of the ""Cop Killer"" controversy. It might be hard to believe that Dr. Dre shied away from any controversy on an album that included ""Fuck Wit Dre Day"" and ""The Day the N****z Took Over."" But as The Chronic was being prepped for release, one song, ""Mr. Officer"" featuring RBX and Prince Ital Joe, was removed from the running order. The furor over Body Count's ""Cop Killer"" had recently resulted in the track being removed from copies of Ice-T's band's album â€“ so Dre preemptively ditched the track (with its ""Mr. Officer, I wanna see you layin' in a coffin, sir"" chorus) before the album ever hit stores.4. Eazy-E directly profited from sales of&nbsp;The Chronic. The Chronic opens with Dr. Dre dissing his former N.W.A groupmate Eazy-E, but Eazy actually netted a significant profit from the album that calls him a ""penguin-lookin' motherfucker."" Interscope had to pay off Eazy and Jerry Heller's Ruthless Records in order to resolve Dr. Dre's contract disputes and release the album. In S. Leigh Savidge's 2015 book Welcome To Death Row: The Uncensored Oral History of Death Row, record promoter Doug Young estimates ""Eazy was getting like 25 or 50 cents a copy for Dre's Chronic album."" That means that Eazy raked in as much as $1.5 million from the LP, which had been certified triple platinum by the time of his death in 1995.5. A family connection brought Dre and Snoop together. Although Dr. Dre was already a well-connected star when he made The Chronic, he handpicked a largely unknown supporting cast of rappers and singers to help write and perform the album, most notably a trio of Long Beach friends: Warren G, Nate Dogg and the album's breakout star, Snoop Doggy Dogg. The LBC trio, who had a group called 213, got in their foot in the door via Dre's family: He and Warren became stepbrothers when Dre's mother married Warren's father. Dre was handed a 213 demo tape by his stepbrother, flipped when he heard a teenage Snoop rapping over the En Vogue hit ""Hold On,"" and the rest is history.6. Snoop looted in the L.A. riots and brought merchandise to the studio. The Chronic sessions were underway at the Hollywood offices of SOLAR Records in April 1992 when the Rodney King verdict sparked the L.A. riots, which directly influenced songs on the album like ""The Day the N****z Took Over."" Dre raps about looting in the riots himself in the song (""got a VCR in the back of my car""), but in this year's HBO miniseries The Defiant Ones, Dre says he never joined on the looting. Several others in the Death Row crew, however, did, including Snoop Dogg. ""I went out lootin' and stole all kinds of shit and brought it all back to the studio,"" Snoop recalled in the documentary.7. The D.O.C.'s new voice made itself useful on ""$20 Sack Pyramid"" Five months after Dr. Dre's talented protÃ©gÃ© the D.O.C. released his hit 1989 album No One Can Do It Better, his larynx was crushed in a car accident, leaving his with a much raspier new voice. The D.O.C. continued writing rhymes for Dre and N.W.A, but it would be several years before he regained enough of his voice to rap again on his second album, 1996's Helter Skelter. However The D.O.C.'s voice can be heard briefly in skits on both N.W.A's 100 Miles and Runnin' EP and on The Chronic. On the latter, The D.O.C. plays the shaky-voiced game show contestant on ""The $20 Sack Pyramid.""8. The D.O.C. wrote the ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" chorus. Snoop Doggy Dogg wrote rhymes for himself and Dre throughout The Chronic. But the chorus that helped make Snoop into a star was actually supplied by the album's silenced ghostwriter the D.O.C., who came up with the irresistible ""It's like this and like that and like this"" refrain.9. P-Funk is sampled five times on ""Dre Day"" alone.George Clinton's pioneering Seventies bands Parliament and Funkadelic had been sampled a few times by N.W.A and other rap groups before The Chronic, but it was Dre's solo debut that made P-Funk's outlandish grooves into the unlikely sonic backbone of gangsta rap. At least 11 tracks by Clinton &amp; Co. are sampled across The Chronic, with five alone on ""Fuck Wit Dre Day,"" including the bass from Funkadelic's ""(Not Just) Knee Deep"" and the chant from Clinton's ""Atomic Dog.""10. Dr. Dre is still owed royalties for The Chronic. Although Dre is the richest man in hip-hop thanks largely to selling his Beats brand to Apple, he's long been denied millions of dollars in royalties from his most famous album. He walked away from Death Row in 1996, giving up many of the profits from the album for the ""peace of mind"" of cutting ties with Suge Knight. And in the years since Death Row filed for bankruptcy in 2006, Dre's been unsuccessful in recouping unpaid royalties for an unauthorized re-release of The Chronic, losing a court ruling in 2014.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,Douglas Wolk,2017-11-27T17:39:00.000Z,'Magical Mystery Tour': Inside Beatles' Psychedelic Album Odyssey,"beatles albums, beatles songs, magical mystery tour, Magical Mystery Tour movie, lucy in the sky with diamonds lyrics, john lennon songs, paul mccartney songs, beatles psychedelic, i am the walrus meaning,Strawberry Fields Forever lyrics ",Rolling Stone,"The year leading up to the release of the Magical Mystery Tour album in November 1967 was turbulent but fantastically fertile for the Beatles â€“ they were working on its songs more or less simultaneously with the ones that ended up on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Yellow Submarine soundtrack. With touring no longer a question, they had the luxury of fine-tuning their songs at length in the studio; the same band that had recorded its first album in a single day was now tinkering with individual recordings for weeks on end.&nbsp;If Sgt. Pepper was a blueprint for the Beatles' new utopianism â€“ a culture of vivid sensory experience, for which they could be the entertainers and court jesters â€“ the Magical Mystery Tour project was an attempt to literally take that idea into the world. Paul McCartney's concept was that the Beatles would drive around the British countryside with their friends, film the result and shape that into a movie over which they would have total creative control. But like a lot of Sixties attempts to turn utopian theory into practice, the movie fell on its nose: The Beatles simply werenâ€™t filmmakers. ""You gotta do everything with a point or an aim, but we tried this one without anything â€“ with no point and no aim,"" McCartney admitted the day after it premiered. The Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack, on the other hand, did what the movie was supposed to do â€“ despite being a grab bag of the group's 1967 singles and songs recorded specifically for the film, it holds together surprisingly well as an addendum to Pepper, giving us an image of the psychedelic Beatles refining their enhanced perceptions into individual pop songs so potent that they changed the whole landscape of music. 			 				 					 												The songs that would end up on Magical Mystery Tour began taking shape in late 1966, well before McCartney was struck by his cinematic vision. From November 24th, 1966, to mid-January 1967, the Beatles worked extensively on a pair of new songs, intended for what would become Sgt. Pepper: John Lennon's ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and McCartneyâ€™s ""Penny Lane,"" both reminiscences of the Liverpool of their childhood. By the end of January, though, EMI was demanding a new Beatles single â€“ there hadn't been one since ""Yellow Submarine"" the previous August, an impossibly long gap in those days. George Martin wasn't happy about pulling ""Penny Lane"" and â€œ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" off the album-in-progress, but there wasn't much else in the can. Released on February 17th, the single was a worldwide hit, and a statement of purpose for the rest of the Beatles' recordings that year: reflective, druggy, a little nostalgic, and more inventively orchestrated and arranged than anything else around.						That spring, with Sgt. Pepper all but complete, McCartney visited California, hanging out with members of the Beach Boys and the Mamas and the Papas. Along the way, he got the idea for an hour-long movie that would document a free-form bus trip, a sort of British equivalent of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters' adventures in their bus, Further. McCartney drew a diagram of how the Magical Mystery Tour film would be structured, and wrote a theme song for it, which the Beatles recorded over a series of sessions in late April and early May. 											 				 			The next song they tackled was Lennon's ""Baby, You're a Rich Man,"" a scathing portrait of a social arriviste that may or may not have been intended as a jab at manager Brian Epstein. Relations between the Beatles and Epstein had become slightly strained. When he turned up in the studio to announce that heâ€™d booked them to debut a new song on the first-ever live global-satellite-transmitted TV special, Our World, they were nonplussed â€“ he hadn't asked them first if they were interested. Lennon agreed to come up with a song for the show, then promptly forgot about it; when he was reminded that the show was a couple of weeks away, as engineer Geoff Emerick recalled later, Lennon groaned, ""Oh, God, is it that close? Well, then, I suppose I'd better write something."" 			 				 					 						Our World aired on June 25th, 1967, three weeks and change after Sgt. Pepper had been released. The song Lennon had grudgingly slapped together to fulfill his obligation was another triumph: ""All You Need Is Love,"" the signature anthem of the Summer of Love. The Beatles performed it live on the air (with the help of a prerecorded backing track), accompanied by an enormous crowd of their cohorts, including Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, on whose ""We Love You"" Lennon and McCartney had sung a month earlier. When ""All You Need Is Love"" was rush-released as a single, the flip side was ""Baby, You're a Rich Man."" 			 				 										That's about all they managed to do together over the month and a half following the Our World broadcast. Their relative lack of productivity wasnâ€™t a sign of the internal unrest that would soon surface; they were still very much a unit, and did everything by consensus. ""If three of us wanted to make a film, for instance, and the fourth didn't think it was a good idea, we'd forget about it,"" McCartney said at the time. In late July, Lennon, George Harrison and McCartney traveled to Greece with the idea of buying an island and building a commune and a recording studio there. 					The reason for the artistic slowdown was simple: It was a beautiful summer â€“ there were parties to go to and drugs to take, and Ringo Starr's wife, Maureen, was very pregnant. Among those parties was a big bash at Epstein's house; he'd asked the band to arrive early so they could discuss something important. But, as Harrison later recalled, ""Everybody was just wacko. We were in our psychedelic motorcars with our permed hair, and we were permanently stoned ... so we never had the meeting.""&nbsp;The bandmates did do a little work, convening in late August to run through McCartney's old-timey number â€œ""Your Mother Should Know."" They also had an audience with the Transcendental Meditation guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who would become a hugely important figure in their lives over the next year.&nbsp;On August 27th, Brian Epstein was found dead of an accidental prescription-drug overdose. The Beatles had been drifting away from him for a while â€“ his management contract with them was close to expiring, and it wasn't clear whether they were going to renew it â€“ but he'd directed the band's business for close to six years, and had helped to transform the Beatles from a scruffy beat combo to an all-conquering cultural force. 			 				 					 						""We loved him, and he was one of us,"" Lennon said at the time. Epstein really had been a crucial part of their organization â€“ the person whose business acumen gave them the freedom to concentrate on their music. The Beatles' creative chemistry thrived on their differences as artists, but it was their business problems that would ultimately tear them apart a few years later. As Harrison later put it, ""We didn't know anything about our personal business and finances; he had taken care of everything, and it was chaos after that.""						A few days after Epsteinâ€™s death, the Beatles had reconvened to continue with Magical Mystery Tour, and not to look for a new manager. Between September 5th and 8th, they laid down three particularly tripped-out songs: Harrison's blurry ""Blue Jay Way"" (inspired by his early-August trip to Los Angeles); the instrumental jam ""Flying,"" which was co-credited to all four Beatles; and most famously Lennon's ""I Am the Walrus,"" a free-associative vision produced under the influence of Lucy in the sky with diamonds. ""The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend, the second line on another acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko,"" Lennon later said. 						All three tracks were intended for the movie, which started principal photography the next week, without a script or anything more than a few stoned concepts. From September 11th to 15th, the psychedelic bus drove around the West Country, occasionally stopping to shoot whatever seemed like a good idea at the time. The Beatles ducked into EMIâ€™s studios on the evening of the 16th to rerecord ""Your Mother Should Know,"" which they'd begun work on days before Epstein's death; the next week, they shot more material for Magical Mystery Tour, including the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band at a strip club, performing a song called ""Death Cab for Cutie"" (the song would later give rise to the rock band of the same name). As first-time directors, the Beatles figured it would probably take a week or so to edit their 10 hours of footage down to something usable.						It eventually took 11 weeks. The problem was partly that everyone had their own ideas about what should and shouldn't be in the movie, and partly that they'd neglected to get some important material on film and had to go back to shoot it. Still, the band made it down to Abbey Road for a handful of sessions between September 25th and October 25th, completing the spacey trio of songs it had started in early September, and recording McCartney's ""The Fool on the Hill"" and ""Hello Goodbye"" (the latter released on November 24th backed with ""I Am the Walrus""). 						The Magical Mystery Tour movie was finally broadcast on BBC television on December 26th, 1967, and became the first Beatles project to be an outright flop. (It didn't help that the BBC aired it in black-and-white rather than color.) The reviews were savage. ""They thought we were stepping out of our roles, you know,"" Lennon groused a few months later. ""They like to keep us in the cardboard suits they designed for us. Whatever image they have for themselves, they're disappointed if we don't fulfill that. And we never do, so there's always a lot of disappointment.""											 				 			As an LP, Magical Mystery Tour&nbsp;was an unqualified triumph, sitting atop the American charts for eight weeks and eventually going sextuple-platinum. It extended and refined the Beatles' version of psychedelia: a vision of the world that was essentially colorful, reflective and loving, but encompassed bad trips as well as good ones.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,Patrick Doyle,2018-01-26T14:46:40.099Z,"Jack White on Genre-Blending New LP, Lost White Stripes Song, Touring","jack white, jack white new album, jack white interview, jack white rolling stone",Rolling Stone,"Before Jack White walked into a New York recording studio, he issued himself a challenge: Spend only three days recording a new batch of songs with a group of musicians he had never played with. Many of them were from the hip-hop world â€“ he had reached out to players he'd seen with Jay-Z, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and others. ""I had no idea if we'd be able to communicate musically,"" White says. ""It could've been a recipe for disaster. I think it would scare the hell out of most people, so it was very enticing to me.""Within 10 minutes of playing, White knew his plan would work. ""There was so much amazing music being played,"" he says. ""Some of those songs could take up an entire side of an album, like a Miles Davis record or a Funkadelic record. Then someone would do something and another mood would change the room."" White booked three more days with different players in L.A., and then took the music home to edit down and add new elements, much like Davis did on Bitches Brew. The result is Boarding House Reach, White's most freewheeling LP yet, featuring him leading the charge through several extended jams with flashes of psychedelia, jazz, guitar fireworks and digital trickery. ""It almost hurt my feelings to condense some of those songs, but I wanted to make it relatable in 2018,"" he says. ""The entire record, to me, is incredibly modern. I wanted to take punk, hip-hop and rock &amp; roll, and funnel it all into a 2018 time capsule.""After touring heavily behind his two solo albums, 2012's Blunderbuss and 2014's Lazaretto, White had taken about two years off. ""I wanted to be with my children as much as possible while they were still in their single-digit ages,"" he says. To start writing the music, he rented an apartment near his home in Nashville. ""The idea was to use the exact same equipment I had when I was 14, the same reel and mixer, and say, 'If I knew then what I know now, what would I do differently?'â€‰"" The first song he wrote was ""Connected by Love,"" a synth-drenched plea for forgiveness by a humbled ex-lover who had burned all his bridges (White says it's fictional). The song was initially called ""Infected by Love."" ""I thought people might turn that into 'Do you have an STD or something?'â€‰"" White says, laughing. ""I'm still learning about that song. The melody was coming straight from my gut."" Once he was playing with groups he had assembled, White decided to revive a favorite of his: the manic stomper ""Over and Over and Over,"" which he had written 13 years earlier and attempted to record with the White Stripes, the Raconteurs and even for a scrapped Jay-Z collaborative project. ""I was just gonna hand it off to my grandchildren,"" White jokes. ""It was sort of my white whale. I chased it and chased it, and finally, all of a sudden, it worked.""White will bring the songs on the road beginning in May. As in recent years, he will tour two weeks on, two weeks off so he can spend time with his kids. ""I tour like you're not supposed to. It's not a good thing to do to make money and pay for the trucks and all that jazz,"" he says, adding he wants to take his live show ""to a new place with new musicians."" White isn't planning to bring two different bands on the road; in 2012, he traveled playing separate nights with all-female and all-male groups. The tour will include several summer festivals like New York's Governors Ball. ""Every musician out there has to play festivals now, whether you like it or not,"" he grumbles. White acknowledges that his new recording process couldn't be more different from his White Stripes days, when ""we'd record and mix the whole album in a week."" But he stresses those records have something important in common with his new work. ""I've always made it my job to push myself into uncomfortable situations,"" he says. ""If you're an artist, your job's not to make life easier on yourself and make other people do your work for you. I've never been a fan of people who do that, and I don't respect that sort of way of attacking music.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,Brittany Spanos,2018-01-03T16:20:00.000Z,From Cuba With Pop: Camila Cabello's Rise,"camila cabello, camila cabello interview, camila cabello rolling stone, fifth harmony, camila cabello fifth harmony, camila cabello album",Rolling Stone,"Camila Cabello is lounging backstage in Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., eating spicy Takis corn snacks and trying to figure out what to do with a rare bit of free time. In three hours, 2017's fastest-rising pop star will be gyrating onstage in knee-high boots and a corset, but at the moment, she's dressed like a college kid, in an oversize gray sweater and leggings, her glossy brown hair in a bun. It's a Monday in mid-December, the kind of frigid day in a boring city that makes Cabello, 20, wish she was back home in Miami. But there's always Netflix. ""Do you wanna watch reruns of Friends?"" she asks, sounding genuinely excited about the idea.Right about now, Cabello is excited about pretty much everything, and who could blame her? It's been almost a year since she parted ways with the hitmaking girl group Fifth Harmony, who were assembled back in 2012 by judges including Simon Cowell on the now-defunct U.S. version of The X Factor. And launching her solo career now looks to have been a great idea â€“ even if it angered some fans at the time (and left the now-four-member group with a name that makes no sense). Cabello has a smash single that happens to be close to her heart: the irresistible, clave-tinged, Young Thug-assisted ""Havana"" â€“ ""an ode to my heritage, my culture"" that began as just a title in notes on her iPhone. The track â€“ which finally finds a distinctive use for her big, sultry voice â€“ pays homage to the Cuban capital, where she was born to a Mexican dad and a Cuban mom, who is hanging out in the dressing room right now. The song's success also helped Cabello figure out a direction for her upcoming album: Her next single, the rock-tinged ""Never Be the Same,"" is almost as singular, with a breathy chorus that pushes near the top of her range. (In the live version, she even plays electric guitar.)Cabello's family immigrated to the U.S. when she was six, which lends a poetic appropriateness to her ascent in our Trumpian era. ""I didn't even realize,"" she said recently, ""how much racism was still prominent in our country."" When she first arrived in Miami, she couldn't speak English â€“ and was shy on top of that â€“ so she'd do her best to lure new friends by blasting pop tunes on a boombox. ""That was my way of communicating,"" she recalls. ""My grandma always said that I had this really strong inner world.""She's been touring and recording nearly nonstop since age 15, when she went on X Factor â€“ against her parents' wishes, though they ended up driving her to the audition â€“ inspired by a YouTube clip of One Direction giving performance tips (Cowell assembled that group, too, on the show's U.K. version). Success followed, but along the way, something definitely went wrong within Fifth Harmony. That became clear to the outside world when Cabello breached pop protocol and started putting out solo tracks, including her hit duet with Machine Gun Kelly, ""Bad Things,"" before officially leaving the group. But Cabello, who started writing her own songs by age 16, isn't ready to tell all, blaming an aversion to drama and an unwillingness to bum out fans â€“ she won't even say whether she actually quit or was thrown out. ""A lot of my fans were, or are, fans of the group,"" she says, losing her usual enthusiasm as the conversation turns to her least-favorite topic. ""I don't like to ruin the dream. They believed in something that's beautiful. I'm sure with One Direction, too, nobody really saw behind the scenes. You just see the dream.""She's growing and changing so fast that she's switched the title and vibe of her first album, due January 12th, in midstream. She had originally given it the rather melodramatic title The Hurting, the Healing, the Loving, with a downer teaser track, ""I Have Questions,"" to match. Its lyrics could be about the nasty breakup of a relationship or, um, the messy demise of, say, a five-member singing group: ""I gave you all of me,"" she sang. ""My blood, my sweat, my heart and my tears.""But that was way back in May. The album is now just called Camila, and it's way more upbeat than she initially planned. ""At first I thought it was gonna be, like, a sad-song album,"" she says. ""Then the more I got into the year, it just was better. I felt way happier. I feel that it has a good balance of the emo and the happy.""The coming year will once more be filled with promos and touring. But Cabello wants to make sure she doesn't miss out on real life along the way. ""The way that I have worked,"" she says, ""makes it hard on relationships, on friendships, even health.""Lack of time may be one reason why she's never had a serious relationship. That said, ""I always have a crush on somebody,"" she says. ""It's just how I am! It's boring without that. A girl's gotta daydream!""When she recorded tracks for her album in L.A. this year, she felt adrift, isolated. ""I do like to forget that I'm a singer or somebody that's famous,"" she says â€“ she couldn't pull that off out there. ""In L.A., it was hard to have people just look at me as a 20-year-old kid. It was like I didn't really have a life outside of the studio.""She always imagines being ""super-old"" andlooking back at her life, which is why many of her dreams have nothing to dowith music. ""I want to be able to go to Italy, to live in Spain for a fewyears,"" she says. ""I want to go to New York and get my apartment, andI want to fall in love."" Today is all about meet-and-greets (with red Takidust still on her fingers), radio interviews and performing for an arena fullof screaming fans. But she can picture another existence. ""I really dowant to live,"" she says. ""I just want to be a kid sometimes.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,David Browne,2017-11-22T15:00:00.000Z,Dickey Betts: The Lost Allman Brother,"dickey betts, dickey betts interview, allman brothers, allman brothers band, gregg allman, allman brothers dickey betts, warren haynes",Rolling Stone,"Leaning forward on a couch in his home on the west coast of Florida, two cans of Budweiser in front of him and Duane Allman's Dobro on a stand nearby, Dickey Betts hesitates. ""I don't know if you want to write this or not,"" he says. ""But, shit, my career is over, so I don't give a shit.""He starts talking about an incident in 1993, when Betts, along with Bob Dylan, the Band, Stephen Stills and others, had been invited to play at a Bill Clinton inauguration event. Betts' performance was shaky â€“ the house band was so inept, he says, it could barely get through ""Southbound,"" a song from his years with the Allman Brothers Band. Backstage, Betts recalls, he met ""a real smartass in a three-piece suit"" who told him, ""â€‰'You got to do some woodshedding to play with the big boys.'â€‰"" Betts became enraged, slugging the guy and knocking him onto Dylan, who was napping on a couch. Betts was afraid he had hit a congressman, but it turned out he was another act's drug dealer. ""It was really a relief,"" Betts says. ""I was worried about the police comin' to arrest me."" The Allman Brothers Band were among rock's hardest-living groups, and Betts more than lived up to his side of that deal â€“ from taking swings at two cops in 1976 to instigating an Allmans band brawl 20 years later. Trashed hotel rooms and arrests are as much a part of his legend as signature songs like ""Ramblin' Man"" and ""Jessica."" With his horseshoe mustache and moody-cowboy image, Betts was so charismatic that Cameron Crowe based one of the central characters in Almost Famous â€“ Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond, played by Billy Crudup â€“ on Betts. ""Cru-dup's look, and much more, is a tribute to Dickey,"" Crowe says. ""Dickey seemed like a quiet guy with a huge amount of soul, possible danger and playful recklessness behind his eyes. He was a huge presence."" He still is. Betts' white hair and stout frame make him look like a Confederate soldier. Hunting accessories â€“ bows and arrows â€“ sit near his Grammy Awards in his high-ceilinged living room, where he relaxes with his dog, Mandy. ""You really got to control her â€“ she'll play with you and then draw blood with her damn claw,"" Betts warns. Betts, 73, unamicably parted ways with the Allmans in 2000; today he considers himself retired. He last played live with his band three years ago, at a 300-capacity club in Mill Valley, California. Soon after, the death of his brother sent him into a depression, and his back was bothering him so much that he worried about relying on Vicodin to get through shows: ""It's a little bit of burnout, a little sour grapes, a little bit like a boxer who gives it up. It's pretty tough, to tell you the truth. Everyone wishes they could be young forever. But I feel like I did my work, and I'm not gonna do anything that's gonna top what I'm known for. So why don't you just stay home?""For all his excesses, Betts has outlived every founding member except drummer Jaimoe. Drummer Butch Trucks committed suicide in January, and Gregg Allman succumbed to various health issues, primarily liver cancer, in May. ""You don't know the fuckin' half of it,"" Betts says, solemnly, of recent events. Betts gives a tour of his home, full of Allmans artifacts. Gold-album certifications for landmarks like At Fillmore East and Eat a Peach are mounted near handwritten letters from then-President Jimmy Carter, thanking Betts for helping to raise money for his 1976 presidential campaign. The mementos are reminders of Betts' vital role in the group. It was Betts who suggested that Duane recruit his younger brother, Gregg, as the band's singer; it was Betts who wrote some of the Allmans' most enduring material (from the jazzy instrumental ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" to rare later hits like ""Crazy Love""). And it was Betts who assumed the leadership role after Duane died in a 1971 motorcycle accident. ""Dickey had so much reverence for the Allman Brothers' music,"" says Warren Haynes, who joined the band in the late Eighties. ""He looked at it as a sacred thing.""In 1976, the Allmans broke up, Betts telling Rolling Stone, ""There is no way we can work with Gregg again. Ever."" Gregg had testified in court against his drug dealer and road manager, which the bandmates saw as a betrayal. After a three-year reunion that ended in 1982, they re-formed in 1989, and Betts soon became the driving force again, especially after Allman relapsed. ""I have all the respect for Gregg Allman,"" says Betts. ""He was a leader when it came to talent. Duh! But he was never the leader-type personality."" But Betts wasn't easy to work with either. Tired of dealing with his bossiness, drinking issues and unpredictability, the three other founders â€“ Allman, Jaimoe and Trucks â€“ wrote him a letter after a series of rocky shows in 2000, saying he was out of the band until he sobered up. ""He would say, 'I need to go get myself straight,' and that's what he would do,"" Jaimoe says. ""This time he didn't do it. He didn't get fired. He quit."" Betts disagrees, saying he was kicked out thanks to ""a whole clandestine business thing"" that stemmed from the moment he asked manager Bert Holman for an audit of their finances. ""Big fuckin' mistake on my part,"" Betts says. (Holman says he has no recollection of that request.) Whatever the case, Betts was awarded an undisclosed financial settlement and his walking papers. Betts neglects to discuss that period in detail (""I don't want to say anything bad about Gregg""), but he speculates that without all the dysfunction, the Allmans might have gotten even more popular â€“ as revered as the Grateful Dead. ""After Jerry [Garcia] passed away, we were right in the position to move into that next-step thing,"" he says. ""But everyone was fucking my band up. Gregg wanted horns. And it was just so crazy.""&nbsp;It's time to head to Betts' favorite local bar, Mad Moe's. He gets in his pickup and pulls out of his gated driveway, passing a property called the Bay Preserve, a nonprofit center that hosts sports practices, weddings and other events. ""They have 300 teenage kids come over there and they're arrogant as hell,"" Betts says. ""They're driving down the road and won't get out of your way. You work your whole life to get a place like this, and they're renting!""The Bettses have long been irked by the Bay Preserve. In March, Betts' fifth wife, Donna, whom he married in 1989, grew so outraged that she pointed a rifle at a crew team as it paddled past their house. Charged with 18 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Donna was sentenced to 90 days of rehab and 30 days in jail. ""It's a crummy situation,"" Betts says. The incident was the latest bump since Betts parted ways with the Allmans. Betts figured on his own he could draw 5,000 fans and make $20,000 a night. Instead, he wound up playing bars for a fifth that amount and staying in low-rent hotels. Haynes wonders if some fans might not have known Betts' role in the Allmans. ""Dickey wrote a lot of key songs and all those great instrumentals,"" he says, ""but because the band was called the Allman Brothers Band, it was confusing for people.""During their 40th-anniversary run in New York in 2009, Betts was presented with an opportunity to rejoin. Newer members Haynes and guitarist Derek Trucks had made the case he should be invited. But he felt the invitation was halfhearted â€“ just three songs, at the last minute. ""On one level, we were disappointed,"" says Holman. ""On another, we were relieved. It was going to be a tense moment."" Betts once dubbed the later version of the Allmans ""a tribute band,"" but is now more careful with his words. ""Those guys are on the other side now,"" he says, referring to Butch Trucks and Allman. He dismisses rumors of bad blood with Allman, who made several less-than-flattering comments about Betts in his memoir My Cross to Bear. ""That whole idea about me and Gregg not liking each other was bullshit. I liked the old fucker!""Two years ago, Allman said he'd welcome a reunion with Betts, and the comment set off tentative plans for a joint tour. Allman's worsening health prevented it, but he was thinking about Betts to the end. Recording his final album, Southern Blood, Allman left a spot for a solo to be played by Betts. ""Gregg wanted to tie up loose ends,"" says Don Was, who produced the LP. ""[Dickey] was the last one."" Allman never got around to asking Betts to record that part, but the two did speak a few times in the weeks before Allman's death, their first conversations in 17 years. ""Gregg could only whisper, but we got things worked out,"" Betts says. ""We went through the court thing, so he thought I had it out for him. I had to let him know I didn't."" Betts attended Allman's funeral; his son Duane says his father was very quiet.Duane isn't convinced his father has retired. Dickeydisagrees. He's financially secure thanks to a combination of real estateinvestments, licensing and a cut of Allmans merch. After Betts jovially flirtswith waitresses at the bar, it's time to go home. The relentless Florida heatis pounding down. ""I don't really go fuckin' outside until later on,""he says. Arriving home, he steers past the gate and opens his front door. ""I'vehad a great life and I don't have any complaints,"" he says. ""I don'tknow what I would've done to make it different. There are lawsuits I probablycould have dealt with better. But so what? You do the best with your amount oftime.""Gregg Allman, Southern rock pioneer, fused country blues with San Francisco-style improvisation, creating a template for countless jam bands to come.

66,Brittany Spanos,2017-10-30T16:48:00.000Z,The Year of Cardi B,"cardi b, cardi b cover, cardi b rolling stone, cardi b interview, bodak yellow, cardi b bodak yellow, cardi b offset, offset migos, cardi b stripper",Rolling Stone,"Cardi B is butt-naked in the doorway of her hotel bathroom, yelling about her vagina. On a mid-October evening, she's readying herself for a college show in Baltimore, and the toiletries provided by the hotel aren't to her liking. ""That soap gave me the yeast infection of 2017!"" she hollers in her thick Bronx accent. ""My pussy was burnin' like a Mexican taco!"" It takes all of 10 seconds in Cardi B's presence to be reminded of the sheer force and hilarity of her personality. Simply being Cardi B, at maximum volume, made her a star â€“ first on Instagram, then on the VH1 reality show Love &amp; Hip-Hop: New York â€“ before she'd recorded any music at all, let alone knocked Taylor Swift from the top of the pop charts with the sly swagger of her single ""Bodak Yellow."" She is the people's diva â€“ or ""the strip-club Mariah Carey,"" as she once rapped â€“ unfiltered in a way the world often doesn't allow female stars to be. In a culture reshaped by streaming and social media, where the kids, without much corporate nudging, get to decide who the stars are, Cardi B is what you get.Yesterday, Cardi turned 25.â€¨ She took a rare day off, hangingâ€¨ with her entire family â€“ sister, parents, cousins â€“ at her mother's house. But she missed her boyfriend (now fiancÃ©), Offset of Migos, who was touring in Australia. ""I was sad, because it's like, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm not getting no dick on my birthday,'"" says Cardi, whose bedazzled acrylic nails are decorated with tiny reproductions of Offset paparazzi shots. ""But I wasn't going to get dick on my birthday anyway, because I got my period.""She finds a cleanser she can deal with and hops into the shower, before slipping into a bright-red spacesuit-inspired Milano di Rouge jumpsuit, complete with a yellow patch that reads ""Safe sex saves lives,"" part of the designer's anti-HIV initiative. She glances at it and arches her eyebrows. ""Girl,"" she says, ""I don't even use a condom.""It may not seem like it, but this is actually a newer, more cautious Cardi B. After a few social-media controversies â€“ including when she was justly called out for a since-deleted tweet that referred to Kim Jong Un as ""Won Tung Soup"" â€“ she is trying to learn to hold back a bit. ""I used to tell myself that I will always be myself,"" she says. But she worries that she's going back on that vow. ""Little by little, I'm feeling like I'm getting trapped and muted.""Her life is changing fast. She put out her first mixtape, Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1, in March last year, back when she was still Love &amp; Hip-Hop's breakout star. It was a gloriously raw and raunchy introduction that cashed in on her TV catchphrases with songs like ""Washpoppin'"" and ""Foreva."" She released Vol. 2 in January this year, five months before announcing a major-label contract with Atlantic Records.In June came ""Bodak Yellow,"" named in homage to Florida rapper Kodak Black, whose song ""No Flockin'"" inspired its flow. ""Bodak Yellow"" is an unlikely Number One: a tough trap song with zero concessions to the mainstream, or even anything like a conventional pop hook. In a year when the youth power of streaming services, which now count toward chart positions, is changing the very meaning of pop, she's become the first female rapper to score a solo Number One since Lauryn Hill in 1998. Not bad for someone who initially pursued rapping as a way to monetize her reality fame. (""I said, 'TV don't make you rich,'"" recalls her manager, Shaft, who once produced Lil' Kim. ""'You gotta sell something! Waist trainers, hair, something.'"")The pressure is building. Her once-carefree social-media presence has drifted toward moody reflections about the downsides of fame. She's stressed about creating a debut album â€“ the very word ""album"" makes her wince â€“ that can live up to ""Bodak Yellow"" and the best of her mixtape tracks, not to mention the challenge of creating singles that can keep her on the charts and avoid one-hit-wonderdom. There is a chorus of doubters in her head, she acknowledges, and it sounds something like this: ""Can she make another hit, can she make another hit?""She fears failure, and paints a vivid picture of what it might look like: ""If you go broke and lose your career, it's bad â€“ and everybody is talkin' shit about it! At least if you lose your 9-to-5 you don't got millions of people judging you and talking shit while you lost your job.""  Seven years ago, Cardi B was convinced she'd already failed at life. To please her mom, she was studying at a Manhattan community college with plans to become a history teacher. Born Belcalis Almanzar, she'd grown up in the Bronx's Highbridge neighborhood, and she was struggling to survive financially on her own. ""It was just very sad,"" she says, uncharacteristically subdued. She's in the back seat of a black SUV on her way to a performance at Baltimore's Morgan State University, and the college setting is bringing back memories. ""It was very frustrating â€“ you have to pay for everything. When I finally got a job at Amish Market, I had to debate, 'Do I wanna go to class or do I wanna finish my shift?'"" She dropped out after two semesters, and soon took up stripping â€“ a career move helpfully suggested by her Amish Market boss. ""A lot of people wonder, 'Why would anybody want to be a dancer?'"" she says. ""Because there's money!"" She used some of her stripping cash to briefly return to school. ""I kept missing classes,"" she says, ""and quit because I felt like I was already failing. It was such a disappointment."" Her strict Trinidadian mother worked seven days a week at a local college; her Dominican father, who separated from her mom when Cardi was 13, was ""the cool parent,"" she says. For Cardi, his experience doing ""different things in the streets"" was a cautionary tale. ""That's why I be so careful with my money and always try to invest. I see people who have it all and then lose it."" As a kid, Cardi had a sense that she was destined to do something creative, which led her to a performing-arts school on the Bronx's east side. She tried acting and singing (though she was convinced all of her classmates were better), wrote some poetry. But she'd also crack up friends and boyfriends by rewriting songs by, say, BeyoncÃ© to make them ""waaay sluttier."" That hobby caught Shaft's attention years later, leading him to encourage her to pursue rapping seriously. Until then, Cardi B relied on her abilities to charm and to hustle to pay the bills. And it worked: She quickly broke 100,000 Instagram followers in her strip-club days, expanding outward from her loyal customers, mostly on the strength of playful videos â€“ ""sucking dick"" and scamming men were favored topics. After Shaft suggested rapping, he began making beats for her at home, and helped her find a lyrical voice that matched the charm of her delivery. But Cardi â€“ who calls herself ""a negative person"" â€“ had to overcome her own skepticism. She thought hard about her subject matter (her first single: ""Stripper Hoe""), determined to defy haters ""expecting me to drop something trash. It just made me, like, 'Aha, I gotta study these other rappers,'"" she says. ""Study how to do something different from them. You know all these female rappers, they talking about they money, they talking about they cars, so it's like, what's something that I enjoy? I enjoy fights!""&nbsp;A few hours after the show, Cardi B is back in her hotel room, still wearing her red jumpsuit. She's curled up in the bed, blankets piled on top of her, talking about the future in a tone that's almost resigned. ""I cannot turn my life back around,"" she muses. ""I'm already a public figure, I'm famous. â€_ It's like, I might as well keep it going, might as well make the money. People are always going to talk shit â€“ I cannot make myself unfamous.""She's faced an impressively varied set of criticisms and unsolicited opinions. She's been accused of not being a real lyricist (""I'm not trying to be""); of somehow ""not being black"" because of her Latina heritage and light skin (""It gets to the point that you ask yourself, 'Damn, what the fuck am I?'""); of sleeping her way to the top (""I always had sex appeal â€“ and niggas still give me a hard time""). The rapper Azealia Banks has quarreled with her, but Cardi B has tried hard not to play into the narrative that female rappers can't get along. ""It's not even the female rappers that are catty, it's the fans,"" she says. ""They just want that beef."" Her in-progress album is never far from her thoughts. ""I got six, seven solid songs that I like, but I wonder if a month from now, I'm going to change my mind."" All the looming expectations, she admits, are making it harder to come up with songs. ""It's not as fun to do music,"" she says. ""My mind doesn't flow as free 'cause I have so much on my mind."" She's aiming to mix the Spanish and reggae music of her youth with the trap sound that's inescapable at the moment, putting in late nights with her ""Bodak Yellow"" producer, J. White, and dancehall specialist Rvssian. She freely acknowledges she's chasing hits. ""It's so sad to say, and I don't want to be the one to say it, but you gotta follow the trend,"" she says. ""This generation loves to get high. They love to be on drugs. This is why they on that shit: They don't want to think about what you're saying."" She cites Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole as rappers who still write brilliant, conscious lyrics â€“ some part of her might want to try to follow suit, but she feels like she couldn't get away with it. ""A bitch like me, it might not work out for me,"" she says, ""so I'm going to stick to trapping.""It's barely past midnight in Cardi's hotel room, and she is already exhausted. ""I'm an old-ass girl now,"" she says with a sigh, head on a pillow. For all her outrageousness â€“ she finished her show tonight by hopping offstage and twerking in the audience â€“ she's not much of a partier. She stopped smoking weed at 21 because it interfered with her increasing fame and accompanying schedule. She had taken Molly as a confidence booster before stripping but doesn't need it anymore. She rarely drinks. ""If I drink,"" she says, ""it's like, my man is gonna be around, and I'm gonna have sex."" She's been with Offset since a chance meeting with him in New York in February â€“ just after Migos scored their own Number One with ""Bad and Boujee."" ""We polish each other,"" she says, noting they confer on music-biz questions. ""I could always ask him, 'Do you think this is OK to do? Do you think I'm getting tricked?'"" She hasnâ€™t been shy about the ups and downs in her relationship with Offset, like the night in October when she seemed to break up and make up with him on Instagram in the course of several hours. She also hasnâ€™t been shy about her intentions to marry him â€” and, a few days before Halloween, Offset made her dreams come true, popping the question at a Philly concert with a raindrop-shaped ring. She knows she wants to have a family. ""I need to make money for my family and my future family,"" she says. ""I'm not a YOLO person. I think 25 years from now. I think about my future kids, future husband, future house."" And where exactly will she be in 25 years? She smiles dreamily, and says, ""I see myself cursin' at my kids.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,Kory Grow,2018-02-20T16:02:00.000Z,See Doors' Epic 'When the Music's Over' at Last Filmed Show,doors,Rolling Stone,"When the&nbsp;Doors flew to England for their appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival in the summer of 1970, the band was at one of its lowest points. In the spring of the previous year, Jim Morrison had been arrested at a Miami concert and charged with ""lewd and lascivious behavior"" when he allegedly exposed himself to an audience; the group canceled its touring plans and the courtroom drama never seemed to end. So when he and his bandmates took the stage, he was in an unusual mood. ""He was like a pot of boiling water with a lid on top,"" drummer John Densmore recalls. ""He didn't move a lot, but he sang really strong.""Footage of the concert, which was the band's last gig to be captured on film, will come out as Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 on home video this Friday. It was an unusual show for the group â€“ the Doors played at 2 a.m. in near dark, as they didn't know they needed to bring their own lighting â€“ but its performances of hits like ""Break on Through,"" ""Light My Fire"" and ""Roadhouse Blues"" were spot on. Even if Morrison was out of sorts â€“ ""Roger Daltrey offered Jim some peppermint schnapps, and he didn't have any,"" Densmore remembers, ""I thought, 'Whoa, that's different'"" â€“ the chemistry was there. ""Some nights Jim would get a little more, how should I say, possessed,"" he says with a laugh. ""It wasn't like that that night, but there was a feeling.""The clip premiering here, of the Strange Days album's 11-minute closing track ""When the Music's Over,"" shows the group vibing out under a soft red light, as a fully bearded Morrison (""He was incognito,"" Densmore jokes) clenches his microphone. ""Playing that song was intense,"" the drummer says with a laugh. ""I had to take a deep breath before playing it, because it's not a little three-minute pop ditty."" Keyboardist Ray Manzarek nods along to the beat while he bangs out the song's hypnotic intro, and then they all hit with one heavy note as Morrison bellows. From there, it's on.""This was our second epic, after 'The End,'"" Densmore says. ""'The End' was like a love song and then 'When the Music's Over was a statement. You know, 'We want the world and we want it now.' We developed it over time, vamping in the middle section, as Jim would throw in whatever poetry things he wanted. I'm real proud of it, because I had this impulse to stop the beat in the middle, and Ray kept the bass line going and Jim said, 'What have they done to the Earth? ... They stuck her with knives.' And I started stabbing the cymbals like knives. It was like freeform poetry in music.""The Who did Tommy that night at the Isle of Wight,"" he continues. ""They did an opera, we did a symphony.""It was a unique moment at a festival that Densmore considers the end of an era. An estimated 600,000 to 700,000 rock fans showed up to the concert, which also featured Jimi Hendrix, Leonard Cohen, Miles David and Joan Baez, among others. In the drummer's opinion, the festival scene had reached critical mass. Joni Mitchell had to kick a hippie offstage when he interrupted her set. ""I don't know what was going on with the fans,"" Densmore says. ""I don't know if the tickets were priced too high or there was not enough toilets or what the hell. I wasn't near the stage when Joni Mitchell threw out a fan for being obnoxious, but it was odd. So it's an interesting document. It was like the last pop-concert vibe.""If things were bursting loose around the Doors at the Isle of Wight, it hardly compared to what was going on behind the scenes for the band. Morrison had become more and more unpredictable, due to his alcoholism, and Densmore remembers feeling a sense of relief that they'd had to cancel concerts while the singer awaited trial. ""I was lobbying to get off the road for a while,"" he says. ""If he was too drunk in the studio, we could go home.""The Doors only played a handful of shows after the Isle of Wight: a couple of sets in Dallas and what would be their final show with Morrison in New Orleans on December 12th, 1970. The last gig is not an especially fond memory for Densmore.""Jim knew I loved him and his creativity and hated his self-destruction."" â€“John Densmore""That was the one that really put the nail in the coffin of our live careers,"" he says. ""The night before in Dallas was pretty good. We had never played 'Riders on the Storm' live and it worked. We thought, 'Wow, maybe we'll be like a jazz group.' And then in New Orleans, Jim was ... I don't know. He wasn't loaded, but he had no energy. No chi. I'd made a set list and we couldnâ€™t agree past four songs. So Jim sat down on the drum riser in the middle of the show, and I walked around and sat next to him. 'What do you want to play, man?' And this is in front of an audience, and he just sighed. There was no energy. We'd stop and start, and Jim told some jokes that weren't funny.""Ray, Robby and I went out for a drink afterwards â€“ purposely just the three of us â€“ and I said, 'OK, are we done for a while?'"" he continues. ""And they said, 'Yes, thank you.' Because we were so fucking great live, and I hated seeing it erode.""The band made one more album with Morrison before his death, 1971's L.A. Woman, but the camaraderie within the band was different. ""He'd ask me to go drinking with him, and I tended to do it less and less,"" Densmore says. ""You'd get pulled down with him. I knew he was in trouble, but there weren't clinics. There wasn't help. There was AA, but it wasn't cool. It was just kids. Jim knew I loved him and his creativity and hated his self-destruction."" Morrison died of heart failure that July in Paris.Incidentally, Densmore has changed his opinion about how Morrison would have fared had he lived. In the past he said he thought Morrison would have continued to be a drunk, but now he thinks differently. ""I used to say he'd never be clean and sober because he was a kamikaze drunk,"" he says, ""but now I've changed my tune. Thinking about Eminem, who's a real creative angry guy like Jim, and Clapton, of course, and maybe he would have. Why not? You know, Ray and Jim went to film school. Maybe he would have sorted it out and would have been making films.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,Hank Shteamer,2018-02-14T17:24:00.000Z,Why People Still Care About Tool's New Album,"tool, tool new album, tool album",Rolling Stone,"The fifth Tool album has become something like alt-metal's&nbsp;Chinese Democracy. This April will mark 12 years since the release of the group's most recent LP, 10,000 Days, and 10 since they started teasing a follow-up. Among journalists and fans, Tool albumspotting has become its own pastime. Information has trickled out as a baffling series of contradictions. Late last year, drummer Danny Carey told an interviewer that Tool's fifth LP would ""definitely"" be out in 2018, while in January, singer Maynard James Keenan&nbsp;took the time to correct a fan who claimed a summer release was imminent: ""Not. Coming out this summer. Not.""Meanwhile, the world keeps turning: The band steps out for arena-scale gigs whenever and wherever it pleases, populating set lists with its ample back catalog. (Their biggest non-festival headlining show to date went down only last year.) Keenan has become a successful vintner, launched his multi-album Puscifer project and even recorded the first&nbsp;A Perfect Circle&nbsp;record in 14 years. Carey performs with chopsy fusion project Volto! and records with nautical-themed supergroup Legend of the Seagullmen. Guitarist Adam Jones plays video games and teases rehearsals on Instagram. Meanwhile, bassist Justin Chancellor assures interviewers that Tool's writing process is well underway.So, like Guns N' Roses' fabled 2008 LP, is this just another case where the project's absence is its main point of interest? I don't think so. This one feels different. Unlike Chinese Democracy, where fans and critics alike fixated on the increasingly farcical spectacle of its nonexistence as much as the prospect of what it could sound like, this is an album people actually seem to care about on a purely musical level. And here's why: Because Tool really are that fucking good.&nbsp;Tool's four albums to date contain some of the richest, most immersive rock music of the past 25 years. And what should by all appearances be a cult band is actually a mainstream juggernaut: The band's prior two albums debuted at Number One; the one before that came in at Number Two. Considering the contents of these releases, the wholly unreasonable demands they put upon a listener's time and attention span, those figures are staggering. Tool's music isn't just dark or perverse; it's radically ambitious, of a kind not seen since the gatefold double-LP days. Early signature songs like ""Sober"" and ""Stinkfist"" still stand as metal landmarks, anchored in the aesthetic of their early-to-mid-Nineties era. (In his autobiography, Keenan noted that the starkness of the band's sound was by design: ""The geometry of this table we were building was very basic. It wasn't Victorian. It was four legs with a top on it, a very simple structure."") But the grandeur of later, more expansive triumphs like ""The Grudge"" and ""Schism"" transcends their era entirely. No band has ever summoned quite the same blend of progressive pummel, captivating dynamics and emotional resonance â€“ or referenced Carl Jung, Bill Hicks and Timothy Leary on the same record, as Tool did on 1996's Ã†nima, which Rolling Stone named&nbsp;the 18th best metal album of all time.&nbsp;In the current musical landscape, Sweden's Meshuggah aim for a similar kind of rhythmic wizardry, while fellow Nineties survivors Deftones combine lush sensuality with raging catharsis, but even these bands' grandest statements seem limited next to the Kubrickian wonder of an album like Lateralus. Considering the musical and lyrical growth Tool exhibited between Undertow, their 1993 full-length debut, and that 2001 album, it's a shame that we haven't been able to monitor their progress as closely during the past decade â€“ a period when, judging by recent live shows, all four band members are at the peak of their musical powers.Tool's deliberate pace and stubbornly old-school approach â€“ they've never made their music available for streaming or even sold it digitally â€“ makes perfect sense. Their music, not to mention their visionary, half-sacred/half-profane album art, is designed as a lavish banquet rather than a quick-fix snack. For those that want to go there, Tool's records are absurdly information-packed, a complex web of angular time signatures (the Fibonacci sequenceâ€“based ""Lateralus"") and brain-bending polyrhythms (""Jambi""), foreboding interludes (""Parabol""), and awesome instrumental poise (the jagged accents that conclude ""Forty Six &amp; 2,"" Carey and Chancellor's undulating groove on ""Schism,"" Jones' searing lead melody on ""Parabola""). But Keenan's dynamic, nakedly emotional delivery and strong ear for a hook give even the band's thorniest tracks an improbable catchiness.Ever since he emerged on the scene, the singer has come off as a kind of freakish prodigy:&nbsp;His 1993 Reading performance of ""Sober"" remains a terrifying spectacle, as the mohawked singer writhes and twitches and roars while tearing at his pink onesie. And his intensity and range only deepened over time. No other vocalist in his peer group could have pulled off both the shrieking vitriol of ""Ticks and Leeches"" and the reflective prayer of ""Wings for Marie (Pt 1)."" He's more reserved these days, usually haunting the back of the stage in some insane get-up, but his voice still possesses an eerie and inimitable power.Assessing the Tool catalog honestly, you could argue that the band's peak is behind them. The sprawling 10,000 Days, while intermittently outstanding, was their shakiest album to date. Clunky lyrics and rambling epics made it the lone Tool LP that can at times feel more taxing than rewarding. It's an open question whether the band's fifth album might be plagued by similar flaws.So why then, after such a long wait, do we still care? Because no other band on earth could possibly fill this void. It's not just that no active band really sounds like Tool; it's that no active band's sonic and conceptual universe feels anywhere near as vast. Eccentricity and mystery are qualities severely lacking in the world of Big Rock. Metallica are still making powerful records; U2 are still scratching that itch; Foo Fighters are still the Foo Fighters; Queens of the Stone Age are masters of their own offbeat niche. But none of these acts â€“ nor anyone else in 2018 â€“ is equipped to spin your head around and leave your third eye pried wide open.Nearly 12 years since Tool put out their most recent album, we present a timeline of everything we know about the band's upcoming LP.

69,Colin Fleming,2017-12-29T16:18:27.224Z,Why Beatles' Star Club Tapes Best Represent the Group's Early Bar-Band Spirit,"beatles star club, beatles live, beatles germany, star club, star club tapes, beatles 1962, beatles live 1962, beatles live",Rolling Stone,"Any deep-delver into the Beatles' catalog is familiar with those raging pockets of sound where this band, so often remembered for their beautiful melodies and graceful harmonic transitions, could be one badass mother of a group.It's easy to list favorites indicative of this hell-for-leather slant: the guitar duel on the second side of Abbey Road, the grinding metal-fuzz of ""Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey,"" the jagged, overdriven rhythm and blues coda to ""Money."" But often overlooked are the recordings the Beatles made at Christmastime 1962, all the evidence that exists of this unit as a literal bar band. They are the toughest recordings the Beatles ever made, the rawest, the most fun, perhaps, judging by their comments while making them, and maybe the most purely Beatles-esque, for it was a badass mother of a band the Beatles first set out to be, not the sonic wizards of a Revolver or a Sgt. Pepper.&nbsp;But first, some problems. The Beatles did not want to be back in Hamburg for the close of 1962. ""Love Me Do"" had made its brief climb up the charts in October. The band was becoming bigger. Hamburg was the old way, the ascent up the hill, playing in dives for drunken sailors, prostitutes, shady club impresarios who had no problem beating patrons they did not care for in back alleys.The late 1962 Star Club residency, from December 18th to December 31st, was to be the Beatles' third and final stint in Hamburg. Earlier in the spring, at their first Star Club stint, they had been informed of the death of original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe. Ringo Starr had come aboard in August. Discounting a few times Starr sat in while with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes as a temporary member, this marked the only time the Beatles, as the world came to know them, would take the Reeperbahn stage.We do not know exactly what night or nights these club recordings come from â€“ though New Year's Eve seems likely â€“ but for all of their shady provenance, there is little doubt with some matters. Former manager Allan Williams, responsible for the Beatles' first Hamburg gig, claimed that the tapes were recorded over three or four nights. They were made by Adrian Barber, stage manager for the Star Club, at the bequest of Ted ""Kingsize"" Taylor, leader of the Dominoes, apparently sensing that these Beatles were up to something, and might become commercially viable. The Star Club was easily the best Hamburg club the band played, with a capacity of 2,000 and theater seating, relatively posh compared to the Indra Club from their first Hamburg sojourn in August 1960.This is where legal issues get tricky. The story is that John Lennon signed over the rights to what was to be recorded in exchange for Taylor buying the band beer throughout the evening(s). (Would this drunken deal really have lasted more than one night, with Taylor repeatedly setting up, stageside, to record?) In the wake of the Beatles' fame, an attempt was made to say that the recordings dated from the spring, thus coming before the band's contract with Parlophone, and Taylor having first dibs. Alas, the vintage of some of the songs themselves, and the band's own between-song chatter, rule this out. And as George Harrison later said, ""One drunken person recording another bunch of drunks does not constitute business deals.""But what the Star Club tapes do constitute and represent is the truth that the Beatles were once the best bar band in the world. This is what they set out to be: a hard-charging, harder-rocking group that any other act would be terrified to follow onstage. The tapes comprise 33 songs. Taylor used a Grundig home reel-to-reel recorder, with one microphone, placed near Lennon. It is his rhythm guitar that drives the band's attack. He holds his Rickenbacker in a seemingly choking grip, left hand relentlessly taut on the fretboard, powering the chords of ""Roll Over Beethoven,"" ""Hippy Hippy Shake"" and ""Matchbox."" The latter â€“ sung by Lennon in this incarnation â€“ overlays Carl Perkins' original with the rhythmic drive of Big Bill Broonzy by way of skiffle and Arthur Alexander B sides, and on the Star Club tapes it asserts itself as one of their best-ever covers.The sound, as you can imagine, is raw and immediate. In the mid-1960s, Taylor tried to sell the tapes to Brian Epstein, who thought he couldn't make any money off of them, offering Taylor 20 quid. Then we have Allan Williams, ever the opportunist, popping back into the story, when he claimed to have randomly stumbled upon the tapes in 1972 in an office building, saving them ""from beneath a pile of rubble on the floor."" Williams then partnered with Paul Murphy, the head of Buk Records, who bought the material and created a new label for the purpose of putting it out, called Lingasong. A cool hundred grand was spent on cleaning up the sound, but you, dear listener, are not going to know it. We live in an age of pristine audio niceties, making the Star Club recordings feel like they've been patched in from some sonic time machine, but they always resonate as impeccably present. They are loud, ballsy, hilarious at times. It's a wonder that the Beatles were in the process of being cleaned up by Brian Epstein, because these guys, truly, sound like the older kids at high school who would intimidate the hell out of a younger classmate. And they are fully aware of it. Despite the Beatles' claims that they didn't wish to be in Hamburg for one last kick of the German ale can, you wouldn't know that either from the energy summoned for these performances. ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" rocks harder than the excellent BBC version from the following year, and one can understand why the sailors passing through Hamburg had such an affinity for banging their beer bottles on their tables in time to the Beatles' music. Harrison's lead lines are crazily hot, and he solos just as hard as Lennon works his rhythm parts, taking chances that would be reined in at the EMI studio sessions. Paul McCartney's vocal on the early version of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" attests that all this band needed, for the best ever start to a debut album, was that famed count in of ""One, two, three, fauh!"" And on ""I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry (Over You),"" we have Ringo Starr, whirling drum kit dervish, as Keith Moon before Moon was Moon. Nonetheless, Harrison, who had said that the Beatles were never better than they were in Hamburg, called the Star Club tapes, ""the crummiest recordings ever made in our name."" Apparently, he was not feeling the festive spirit that the band clearly were as they drunkenly toasted each other at the end of their stay that had meant so much to what they had become and would be. If the tapes do in fact originate from New Year's Eve 1962, that seems fitting: It was the last day of the last Hamburg engagement in the last year before the Beatles would mushroom into something larger than a stage at a bar could hold.A 26 song version of the recordings came out in Germany in April 1977. The Beatles were unsuccessful in blocking it. Numerous reissues of dubious legality followed, along with more lawsuits from the Beatles, with ownership finally being decided in their favor in 1998. By then, it really didn't matter: If you wished to hear this material and have it rock your core, you had already done so, just as it's easy to find a version now. The sound is a little better than it used to be, but some recordings work best when you can all but feel the grime of the club from which they sprang, the condensation from the ceiling, the aromatic undertones of hoppy ale, the roaring mega-beat of the band on the stage. ""I'm a roadrunner honey!"" Lennon screams at one point, pumping himself up for the next cut. You think they didn't want to be there? Boll-fucking-ocks.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,Sarah  Grant,2017-11-21T15:42:00.000Z,L7: To Hell and Back,"L7, donita sparks, pretend we're dead, l7 documentary, l7 doc, l7 doc donita sparks, l7 reunion, l7 movie, l7 pretend we're dead doc,",Rolling Stone,"It's Reading Festival, 1992, and L7 singer Donita Sparks has just whipped her bloody tampon into the unruly crowd.&nbsp;""Let's rock the sisters in the house tonight!"" she yells as drummer Dee Plakas kicks into&nbsp;""Fast and Frightening""&nbsp;â€“ a glorious headbanger with the prescient lyric ""She's got so much clit/She don't need no balls."" &nbsp;""I went performance art on their ass,"" Sparks says, looking back on the moment 25 years later. ""They were throwing mud, we threw blood,"" adds bassist Jennifer Finch. These days, fans toss tampons (clean ones) onstage at the reunited punk-metal pioneers' shows with ""I love you"" scrawled in red marker.&nbsp;""Can you imagine Kathleen Hanna [throwing her tampon]?"" says John Norris, the former MTV VJ who interviewed L7 in '92. ""I'm sorry, but no. Carrie Brownstein? No, I don't think so.""&nbsp;But to Sparks, the moment didn't feel as triumphant as it looked. ""We were expecting to keep going up,"" she says. ""That show started the plateau.""From 1985 to 2001, Sparks, Finch, Plakas and guitarist Suzi Gardner made a serious racket, drawing from disparate musical currents. ""Hard rock music with a punk sensibility,"" Sparks likes to say. Watching footage of L7 in their prime â€“ shredding with Nirvana, ruling MTV's video rotation, smashing David Letterman's set â€“ as featured in the new documentary L7: Pretend We're Dead, it's hard to imagine how the rambunctious foursome ever managed to slink away. ""I was amazed because they were strong, kickass women. Now all the women in punk rock are kickass, so maybe they were a little ahead of their time,"" the director John Waters tells Rolling Stone. He famously cast L7 as the prosthetic-vulva-wearing band Camel Lips in his 1994 dark comedy&nbsp;Serial Mom.&nbsp;""They were radical feminists, but they were also pros,"" Waters continues. ""I'm just surprised they vanished so quickly.""&nbsp;Coming up in Los Angeles' bohemian Silver Lake/Echo Park scene, L7 drew from a diverse set of influences: MotÃ¶rhead, Ramones, feminist Bay Area punks Frightwig. They made fun of the Sunset Strip's bouffants and machismo while playing the same kinds of garish flying-V guitars. They also had no patience for grunge's gloom, even though their friends were in bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney and Soundgarden.&nbsp;Pretend We're Dead&nbsp;demonstrates just how far removed L7 were from their peers. Mostly taped by the band members themselves, the film has a home-movie feel. ""It's the ultimate cinema verite,"" says director Sarah Price. ""Early on, Donita gave me a hair color guide â€“ by the year â€“ for every band member, so I could identify the year by the hair color and vice versa. And I just thought, 'Holy shit, she's been through all the footage' â€“ that's, like, 145 hours of tape.""The film is rife with pranks like the one they played on MÃ¶tley CrÃ_e in 1993 upon discovering their studio was plastered with pictures of naked women. ""Walking into a room and seeing all those centerfolds â€“ it's just a bummer,"" Sparks says. ""So [when] Tommy Lee came in to listen to 'Baggage,' we had so many penises in that room â€“ erect penises on the spinning tape machines. It was amazing."" Aesthetics aside, L7's sex anthem ""Freak Magnet,"" recorded during that time, could have easily come from either band's room.During a Pretend We're Dead screening at a Brooklyn theater in October, Sparks, now 54, sat before a small, polite crowd. She sported cotton-candyâ€“blue hair and a svelte blazer. Near the end of the Q&amp;A portion, a young woman in glasses raised her hand.&nbsp;""What do you make of feminism today?"" she asked. The usually intimidating Sparks shifted uncomfortably, as if she'd almost made it out without fielding the question she's perennially punted. The band has always maintained that while they're fiercely liberal â€“ after all, they invented the Rock for Choice concerts â€“ their music relates to everyone. That the band even wound up all-female was a fluke. (""This band transcends the conversation of gender, sexuality and genre,"" Finch tells RS. ""We're just that way as people."")This time, Sparks didn't deflect. She acknowledged that L7's resonance among feminists hit home for her during the film's New York premiere in 2016, just four days after the election. What should have been a joyous event for the band (even Joan Jett was there to welcome them) was eclipsed by Trump-induced grief. ""Young women were literally hanging on to me, asking me to 'save them,'"" Sparks says incredulously.&nbsp;Fittingly, in September, L7 released ""Dispatch From Mar-a-Lago,"" a hysterical caricature of life inside the president's palm tree-lined cave (""S.O.S. from the golden throne/Mogul's in deep shit, he's all alone"") and their first new song in 18 years. Sparks says they were wary they'd look a tad cheap â€“ worse, desperate â€“ for coming back only to pile on the Trump bashing.""But then we were like, who cares?"" she says, her gold tooth winking through her curled lips. ""Let's take the low road!""L7 began in 1985, a year after Sparks met Gardner, a California native and reluctant poet who spoke softly but hung out with bikers. Sparks grew up in Chicago going to political protests with her parents. She revered all things Americana, so moved cross-country to surf rock's babylon: Los Angeles. Gardner became her creative partner and they named their band after bebop shorthand for ""square.""In 1987, the duo became a trio with Finch â€“ an ill-behaved and untrained bassist who added instant verve to their live act. A year later, a petite, chatty punk named Dee Plakas became their drummer. With the highly skilled Plakas on board, the band had a reason to figure out their instruments just to keep up with her. ""When I play, I feel like my arms are going to fall off,"" Plakas says with a laugh.L7 opened for Nirvana&nbsp;when the latter were road-testing songs like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in the U.K. in the summer of 1990. ""One of the first people to say they thought [Nevermind] was going to be huge was Donita Sparks of L7,"" Dave Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2001. ""And I didn't believe her. I was going, 'There's absolutely no way.'"" L7 watched Cobain &amp; Co. get wined and dined by label executives with dollar signs in their eyes. (""The closest thing [we got] was listening to Geto Boys in the parking lot of an In-N-Out with a Warner Bros. rep,"" Gardner jokes.)With a little finesse from Nevermind producer Butch Vig, L7's 1992 record Bricks Are Heavy broke the band on MTV. Their big music video from that album, ""Pretend We're Dead,"" aired alongside clips from mainstream stalwarts like Metallica, Guns N' Roses and Red Hot Chili Peppers.&nbsp;""As much as people like to think grunge was a corrective to the Sunset Strip, let's not kid ourselves â€“ Nineties rock and alt-rock was still very much a dude's world,"" says Norris, whose 1992 MTV conversation with L7 appears in the doc. ""L7's approach was to embrace the kind of leather-dude, 'we can party as hard as you, rock as hard as you' mentality, which was so different from other bands.""L7 did take a feminist stance, but it wasn't exactly academic. When a promoter touched Sparks inappropriately on the road, the band members took turns peeing in his hat. (""Sometimes there's a method to our madness,"" Sparks says with a laugh.) They embraced politics in other ways. In 1991, they created the Rock for Choice festivals with the Feminist Majority Foundation to raise money and awareness for&nbsp;women's reproductive rights issues, which drew huge acts including Rage Against the Machine and Neil Young.&nbsp;But by the time of the tampon incident, the grunge wave that L7 rode was waning. Upbeat acts like Green Day and Blink-182 became the new alternative. After L7 opened for Kiss at a festival in 1997, they learned that their label dropped them.Finch had already left the band. Plakas, Sparks and Gardner self-released what would be the band's final album,&nbsp;Slap-Happy, in 1999 on their independent label, Wax Tadpole. When copies of the record were too expensive for them to buy back, most wound up in a landfill. Gardner parted ways with Sparks and Plakas in 2001. The band was over, along with their friendship.""It was a very painful breakup,"" Sparks says. ""I felt betrayed. And we're not family, so it's not like we had to be in touch. There's no Thanksgiving at Grandma's house.""""I was surprised that [L7] felt they didn't make it, because we looked up to them,"" says Gina Volpe, guitarist of the Lunachicks, who frequently opened for L7 in the Nineties. As unique as they sounded, L7 suffered more than their peers from the ""all-girl band"" trope, says Volpe. ""It's maddening. And we lived it too.""Sparks isn't one to dwell. But over the years, between social media and renewed interest in Nineties nostalgia, she found it increasingly tough to ignore that her band seemed in danger of being forgotten. One evening, Sparks sat down to watch HBO's 2013 documentary,&nbsp;Sound City,&nbsp;about the historic recording studio&nbsp;where L7 recorded portions of four of their LPs.&nbsp;They spent a lot of money there, she says. The documentary was even produced and directed by her old friend, Dave Grohl. Sparks waited for a mention that never came.Not long after that, Sparks made the two phone calls she'd avoided for 13 years. She wasn't asking for a reunion, she says vehemently. She simply wanted to see if her old bandmates would participate in a documentary on the band. She began with Finch, who left the band at age 30 with just a handwritten note. The bassist was newly sober at the time and grappling with her father's death. ""When you're younger, there's so much pressure riding on everything,"" says Finch. ""I know I caved under that specific pressure â€“ of not being able to be everything [I felt] was expected.""&nbsp;In the summer of 2011, Finch revealed that she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Sparks was aware of Finch's illness, she says, but felt reaching out might have been awkward, or worse, unwanted. Could they really be a band again? Finch put her doubts to rest with a typical L7 response: ""Duh.""Next was Gardner, who lived just three blocks from Sparks for more a decade without a single exchange between the two. In the film, Gardner says she worried she'd wasted her life being in L7 for so long. In the years after her departure, she devoted her time to caring for her mother. She missed music, but her guitars remained under her bed gathering dust. Sparks says she emailed Gardner asking permission to call, since ""if you give people time for things to sink in, their response is a little bit better."" Gardner says,""I picked up and said, [mimicking Dracula]&nbsp;'Goooood evening.'""""She answered the phone that way like she did back in the day,"" Sparks says with a smile. ""She was filling me in about her mother for the last seven years. She talked about her life and her job. I just let it roll. I wanted to let her talk."" L7 weren't reunited yet, but getting back on speaking terms was a victory in itself.""Life is a succession of hell and backs,"" Gardner says quietly. ""Your partner gets cancer. You go to hell. And you come back.""In January 2015, Blue Hats Creative, the production company run by Sparks' husband Robert Fagan and Maria Aceves, launched a Kickstarter campaign&nbsp;to gauge interest in an&nbsp;L7 documentary. ""I honestly thought no one would remember us,"" Sparks says. On the other hand, she'd seen some promising signs. The L7 Facebook page she casually curated was buzzing more than usual with fans posting old concert clips, posters and interviews.&nbsp;The Kickstarter changed everything. Within one month, fans pledged more than $130,000. One of the highest donations came from Ross Mangun, a 45-year-old manufacturing plant manager from Indianapolis, Indiana. He's not rich and never knew the band personally, but he felt like he owed them.&nbsp;""As a gay teenage kid in the Midwest, my life got 100 times bigger when I discovered L7,"" he says. ""If Vixen was like four Lita Fords, L7 was like four Joan Jetts."" Mangun gave $3,000 to the campaign. For his prize, he was flown out to Hollywood for a seance with the band.Since L7 reunited, quasi-officially, at a hometown gig in 2015, they've had considerable success. They've embarked on sold-out tours, headlining music festivals around the world and playing to a whole swathe of new fans that might've found their song ""Pretend We're Dead"" playing Rock Band 2.""People ask, 'Why didn't this happen sooner?'"" Sparks says. ""Well, heavy shit goes on in life. One day things are rolling along and then life hits you again.""&nbsp;""Plus,"" Finch adds, ""I started seeing documentaries and lists â€“ 100 great drummers or whatever â€“ where Dee Plakas would not be mentioned. And that's some bullshit."" Snickering ensues among the members.&nbsp;L7 might have drifted into obscurity, but when they're together, onstage or off, it feels like nothing's changed.But then, some things have.""All this time I thought I was the toughest cookie in the group."" Sparks pauses, searching for the right words. ""Well, I am fucking not.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,Andy Greene,2017-12-13T16:47:00.000Z,Cars Drummer David Robinson on Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: 'I Had A Feeling',"David Robinson, Cars drummer David Robinson, The Cars Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, David Robinson interview, rock & roll hall of fame 2018, who made rock & roll hall of fame this year, rock & roll hall of fame honorees, cars albums, cars songs, rik ocasek",Rolling Stone,"David Robinson woke up early on the morning the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced their class of 2018. The Cars drummer was told a couple of days earlier by his manager that they'd finally gotten inducted, but he wanted to see the news coverage himself. ""I thought the local stations would be covering it,"" he says. ""Four people called me to say congratulations and I said, 'Nothing has been on.' But it came on while I was taking to the fourth person. Luckily they had some nice footage of us playing live, so it was good.""About three hours later, he called up Rolling Stone to talk about the big honor, why he basically stopped playing drums when the Cars broke up in 1987, the short-lived reunion in 2011 and why he feels late bandmate Benjamin Orr (who died in 2000 at age 53) would have been thrilled by the news. How do you feel?Well, we've been through it twice already. I just sort of had a feeling we could squeak in this year. But it's great. It's great. It's also a good time for us. Next year is the 40th anniversary of our first album [The Cars]. I've been working all this year on a bunch of re-releases. We've had some expanded records and I've worked on the covers. It's a good time.&nbsp;What does this mean to you on a personal level?I think it's a nice honor. Like a lot of people, maybe the only thing about the Hall of Fame is that they've been inducting things that aren't rock and roll. I think they should change the name of the place or just re-think what they're doing. Nina Simone? I'm not sure if she was a big supporter of rock &amp; roll. That seems a little odd to me.There's also Dire Straits, Bon Jovi and the Moody Blues. Are you a fan of those groups?Yeah. That's great. I've voted a few times for other bands, not particularly those bands. [Chuckles.] If it's going to be sort of historically viable, I'm not sure what their standards are or anything about who they vote for or how they vote and why. At different times I was suspect at who got in and who didn't, but when I went and looked at who they inducted I was actually pretty impressed. There were so many things I liked and things I felt were important enough to be there. For the most part, we're in good company. There's loads of acts that are just fantastic and important in the scheme of things, they are in there. But I'm not so sure about other genres. If they're going to bring them in there, they should change the name so their customers know what they're getting.Do you not see hip-hop as part of rock and roll?Very seldom. I think if I was in a hip-hop band, I wouldn't be too impressed if some rock and rollers thought I was a rock and roller.And disco?That's much closer to rock than, say, hip-hop. Maybe it should be Popular Music Hall of Fame? I don't know. If you were a rock and roller and went there, some of the stuff would leave you cold.Are you guys definitely going to perform at the ceremony?We haven't talked about it yet. I'm pretty sure we will. I don't know why we wouldn't. I gotta drag my drums out and practice a bit.Performers tend to do three songs.That's good. It's about as many as I can play. [Laughs]Can you wager a guess as to what they'll be?No. I don't have a clue. We've got a lot of songs to choose from. We'll get together and talk about it. Actually, it'll be fun. Maybe we'll even throw a twist on some of the songs or just do something unusual, change it up a bit.Are you able to imagine an all star jam with you guys, Bon Jovi, Dire Straits and the Moody Blues?No. [Laughs] The Moody Blues, yes, that's what I'm anticipating.Is it true you didn't play drums from the Cars breakup in 1987 until the reunion in 2010?Yeah. I didn't play. I would play once in a while on New Year's. Even in 2010 and 2011 when we did that project and the short tour, I put my drums in storage with the expectation of taking them out and bringing them home at some point, but they're still in storage.Why didn't you play at all when the Cars were inactive?When the Cars first broke up, I just needed a break. Also, I was at a time in my life where I was going in different directions with non-musical [projects.] Of course, when we got back together to record it was great and I felt bad. I had really dropped out of it completely. Mostly, I don't have a place to set things up. I live in an apartment. That's been part of it. I actually just bought a new drum to add to my kit, but I haven't checked it to see if it's going to work. It would be good to get that stuff out and start playing again.How easy was it in 2010 to get back into the swing of playing?Back then I worried that I'd physically be unable to play, I'd get tired or get a bad elbow or something. But it turned out that remembering the songs was the problem. I just had forgotten lots of parts to the songs, and in the case of the new songs from the new album, we had never played them together. We had only worked on them to record, so I was really unfamiliar with those. What I had to do was study the songs for the entire tour, and I think maybe by the end of the tour I had successfully learned to play the parts I played on the album. It was weird.Why weren't you part of the New Cars with Todd Rundgren?Ummâ€_Ummmâ€_.It was, for me, not the kind of comeback I would have wanted. It wasn't the right situation for us all to be back together in.Did they invite you?Yeah. I had an idea of what we should do, and it wasn't that type of thing.Why was the 2011 tour so short?It was a mostly a promotional tour. We sort of didn't have time to book more shows. I think we could have played a few more, but logistically it didn't work out. We weren't ready to gear up for big tours. That wasn't our intention at all when the record came out, but we did enjoy doing those 12 shows.What was it like playing&nbsp;Lollapalooza? All the other shows were theaters and big clubs.We'd done that before. We played a lot of those kind of shows. We played the Pontiac Silverdome, the stadium they just tried to blow up and it didn't blow up. You can't blow it up! We'd played at Cleveland Stadium, which was huge. We played the US Festival, which was at least 300,000 people. Those shows aren't that great since you're a little too far removed from the audience, but&nbsp;Lollapalooza was better since it's a smaller scale. At least I could see the front row.So why didn't you decide to do more shows in 2011?We were old. [Laughs] Touring has never really interested Ric [Ocasek], and now it doesn't interest me much at all. Making records does, but not so much touring. What was easy when you're 30 is a lot harder when you're in your 60s, for a lot of reasons.Did you enjoy the shows?Yeah. I like playing. We never would have gone on tour without a record. That's the thing. We never would have gone on tour just to play old songs.Do you think there might be a future Cars record and a future tour?You never know. I didn't expect us to get back together in 2010.Do you speak to Ric often?Fairly regularly, yeah.How about Greg and Elliot?I speak with them more so. Greg lives near me. I just saw him with Todd Rundgren last Thursday, as a matter of fact.How do you think Benjamin Orr would feel about the Hall of Fame?Ben would be overjoyed. He's from Cleveland. Ben has been sort of a legend in Cleveland since he was a teenager. The town would go crazy if he were still alive and made a comeback appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.When I read about the Cars, critics often write you were better in the studio than on stage. Did that ever bother you?We actually weren't, but I think what people were trying to say is that weren't used to a band just performing their songs. They're used to a big show. In a way, we tried to make up for it by having interesting stage sets, which sometimes didn't get much attention, in my opinion. But we weren't bad live, at all. We just put out a live album that we recorded in Cleveland. I think I maybe had a bootleg version, but never paid much attention to it. But now when I hear it, we were great live. We were incredible, especially back then. I think that people expect a lot of, ""Is everyone all right? Clap your hands!"" kind of show. We never did that type of thing, ever.I suppose if you never play again, the Hall of Fame is a nice final chapter to the saga.Definitely.Will it be emotional for you?We were together in 2011 and that feels like a year and a half ago. I just need to break out my old clothes for the show.What fills your time these days since the Cars aren't active?This year, I've had to work on a lot of album cover stuff. There's going to be a surprise when you see one of the album covers I've been working on. What I had to do is get extra material, sort of update things, so I would have ended up doing five album covers in one year, expect they pushed back the release dates for Shake It Up and Heartbeat City expanded versions. I think they're going to come out in February, but I'm having a blast doing that. It's time-consuming. I have to work on them today as a matter of fact.I have a shop. I make jewelry. I'm pretty much a civilian. Like I said, I would only play once in a while and it would be New Year's Eve out in my little Massachusetts town with my friends. Are you ever recognized in public?Not now. I have a white beard and long, long hair. It's so far in my past that most of my friends have never seen me play. They have no idea what I did. They're like, ""Oh, you were in a big band?"" I'm a guy mowing lawns and painting houses and stuff.So there's never a moment at a restaurant or anything where a fan will spot you?Not at all. When I went to see Greg with Todd Rundgren people were walking up to me and saying, ""We love the Cars!"" I could see that none of them recognized me. Eventually one guy came back and apologized and said he was sorry. I said, ""That's okay. I look completely different. Don't worry about it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joining them at Studio X in Seattle were some new faces: producer Adam Kasper, who had worked with Matt Cameron's bands Soundgarden and Wellwater Conspiracy, and keyboardist Kenneth ""Boom"" Gaspar, who met Eddie Vedder on a remote Hawaiian island in 2001 and joined despite having never previously heard of the band he was signing on with.Nearly all of Riot Act's songs were recorded live, as Vedder hunkered down in a studio alcove and tapped out lyrics on an old-school typewriter while listening to the band playing. ""It's like catching a butterfly,"" he said of the new writing process. ""Just when you think you're going to give up, after, like, hours of sitting there, all of a sudden it cracks and stuff comes out."" The resulting collection of mid-tempo rockers and folky ballads grappled with a pair of still-fresh tragedies: the terror attacks of September 11th, 2001, and the accidental deaths of nine fans during Pearl Jam's set at the June 2000 Roskilde Festival in Denmark. ""The through line is how delicate life is,"" Jeff Ament said. ""The positive part of [Roskilde] is, it reinforces that philosophy ... that you really need to seize the moment and the day and make the most of it."" Vedder took stock in the waltz-like lead single, ""I Am Mine,"" which he wrote the night before Pearl Jam's first post-Roskilde show, ""to reassure myself that this is going to be all right."" The frontman also addressed Roskilde in the sentimental ""Love Boat Captain,"" which he wrote with Gaspar, singing, ""Lost nine friends we'll never know/Two years ago today."" The band's frustration over 9/11 came through in Stone Gossard's ""Bu$hleaguer."" Live, Vedder caused controversy by performing the song wearing a plastic Bush mask. ""It's not anti-American to be critical of the government,"" Vedder said. ""We wanted to put some ideas out there that might help create an open and honest debate.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,Elias Leight,2017-12-19T18:07:00.000Z,Inside Latin Pop's 2017 Takeover,"despacito, mi gente, danny ocean, me rehuso, latin pop, latin hits, luis fonsi, daddy yankee, latin trap, reggaeton",Rolling Stone,"In September of 2016, a young Venezuelan singer named Danny Ocean released ""Me RehÃºso,"" a reggaeton-flavored ode to a lover left behind when he moved to Miami. The bracing, wistful track connected first in Ocean's homeland, zipping up Venezuela's viral chart on Spotify; soon it spread around Latin America, rising up the viral rankings in other countries. Within a year, Ocean had a global smash and a record deal with Warner Music Group.This rapid ascent was just one impressive example of viral successes for Latin pop in a year full of them. On Spotify, global listening to Latin music grew 110 percent in 2017 (compare that to 74 percent growth in hip-hop), and 10 different Spanish-language singles made it onto the platform's Global Top 50 chart, setting a new record. On YouTube, six of the top 10 most-viewed music videos globally were made by Latin artists â€“ as opposed to just one in 2016 â€“ as were 45 of the Top 100. The U.S. mainstream has long been resistant to songs in other languages, but casual listeners who don't speak a word of Spanish now signal recognition when they hear Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's ""Despacito"" or J Balvin and Willy William's ""Mi Gente.""According to artists and executives at both streaming platforms and major labels, several factors conspired to make 2017 the year of Spanish-language pop. Increasingly widespread adoption of streaming services in the Latin American market coincided with those services honing their playlist approach, allowing them to concentrate their considerable muscle on catapulting tracks into global ubiquity. Latin American acts have also relied more on collaboration in recent years, allowing artists to pool their fan bases and enhance the effects of streaming's power. As a result, ""we have a new music-industry landscape which is much more diverse than it could have possibly been before,"" says Rocio Guerrero, Head of Global Cultures at Spotify. ""Streams don't lie. The internet would have to break for this to stop."" The streaming side of the Latin music market has been swelling rapidly for several years. ""I think the first year was 2013 that we started to smell that something like this would happen,"" says JesÃºs LÃ_pez, Chairman/CEO of Universal Music Latin America. Talk to Guerrero, who has watched reggaeton listening on Spotify outpace both hip-hop and pop between 2014 and 2017, or Sandra Jimenez, head of Latin American music at YouTube and Google Play, who saw the listening numbers of Latin pop hits on YouTube increase by 75 to 80 percent in both 2015 and 2016: They knew it was only a matter of time before the numbers became so big that the rest of the world would have no choice but to take note of Latin pop's strength.Nir Seroussi, president of Sony Music US Latin, identifies Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias' 2015 smash ""El PerdÃ_n"" as ""the big ah-ha moment"" when he saw the Latin music market's streaming power assert itself. ""It was meant for our markets, and then it connected globally, and people were accepting it as a hit single, not just as a novelty,"" Seroussi says. After that, he continues, ""you started seeing more and more records following the same pattern. Last year at any given point there were three, four, five [Latin] records in Spotify or YouTube's global chart."" So what seems from afar like an out-of-the-norm explosion in Latin pop in 2017 is really just the logical next step in the growth cycle. But what made the year so exciting was the impressive assortment of young acts that were able to harness this streaming power into breakout years. Ocean took one path to stardom: He rode ""Me RehÃºso"" for months and has only released two more songs to date. Same goes for Chris Jeday, who wrote and produced for reggaeton acts like Wisin &amp; Yandel and Zion &amp; Lennox before releasing his debut single at the end of 2016. He followed that with ""Ahora Dice,"" a springy trap single, in March, and has been content to watch it grow into an undeniable juggernaut â€“ the song's video recently cracked the billion views mark on YouTube, making it the 16th Latin-pop video to reach that threshold in 2017 alone.Contrast this slow-drip release schedule with that of up-and-comers like Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved ubiquity by releasing singles at breakneck speed. Ozuna's lissome, lightweight vocals graced 12 Top 25 hits in 2017; he's a buoyant presence even when heartbroken (""Tu Foto""). Bad Bunny, one of the foremost proponents of the rising Latin trap sound, also showed up on eight Top 25 hits this year. The best of these, ""Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola,"" was so good that he basically made it twice (see ""Sensualidad""), and anyone with passing knowledge of contemporary American hip-hop will recognize his intuitive blend of melodic rapping and low crooning.&nbsp;""Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola"" and ""Sensualidad"" both featured J Balvin, and it's not a coincidence that many of these sterling singles are collaborations: Latin pop acts have helped maximize their power through cooperation in recent years. If you look at the top 25 most popular Latin singles of 2007, just three of those featured guests. But if you look at the Top 25 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart for the week of December 23rd, 19 out of 25 tracks on the list include more than one artist or group. Ismar SantaCruz, a director of radio strategy at Univision, believes the increasing tendency towards multi-artist tracks started when reggaeton became popular more than a decade ago. ""Instead of looking for success alone, [those artists] were looking for success collectively,"" he says. ""It was about elevating the genre to a different level.""&nbsp;""A few years ago,"" he continues, ""that symbolic wall between Puerto Rican reggaeton and Colombian reggaeton started to come down, and now instead of having one song by Daddy Yankee, you have a song that has four other artists on it. It creates this snowball effect that's so much stronger."" The practice has also moved beyond reggaetoneros, and the collaborative impulse in Latin pop has allowed the rising tide of streaming to reach veteran acts as well as youngsters. This is notably different from the American market, where it's mostly young acts that accrue streaming power. But Ricky Martin and Shakira, who released their first albums in 1991, had two billion-views singles apiece this year. The veteran performer Carlos Vives, who became famous by fusing the traditional Colombian music known as vallenato with rock, rarely collaborated on his own singles in the past, but he has teamed up with Daddy Yankee, Maluma, Shakira and SebastiÃ¡n Yatra since 2014. ""'La Bicicleta' [his duet with Shakira] was in markets I didn't expect to be in,"" he tells Rolling Stone, speaking through an interpreter. ""Shakira is so big that people in other markets learned about Carlos Vives. That also happened when I worked with Daddy Yankee and with Marc Anthony. I'm from Colombia, but I've been able to get my music to every part of Latin America."" And now to the rest of the world â€“ ""La Bicicleta"" was one of 10 Latin pop collaboration videos that reached a billion views on YouTube this year.""Our music is a part of the vocabulary of the mainstream world, and now the sky's the limit."" â€“Nir Seroussi, Sony Music US LatinLatin pop has experienced other periods of explosive growth â€“ crossing over in the U.S. behind Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony in the late 1990s and again during the reggaeton explosion of the mid-2000s â€“ that ultimately fizzled. Will this moment be different?Whether or not it continues in the U.S. is now irrelevant: The streaming power of Latin artists is great enough that they can bypass the U.S. market, where traditional gatekeepers like radio have long ignored music from Latin acts. Guerrero says that an act with a hit in Venezuela once required the resources and infrastructure of the U.S. music market to propel that song into worldwide rotation, but ""today that's not the case."" Songs like ""Me RehÃºso"" will make their way to Spotify or YouTube's global chart, where they are easily accessible to listeners far and wide. ""The moment you see those results in the global chart, the game's over,"" she declares.But it's likely Latin pop will continue its North American takeover as well. ""When you hear Ed Sheeran's 'Shape of You,' it's no longer the kick and snare on the downbeat; you've got the snare on the upbeat, and that's Caribbean, that's derived from our rhythm,"" explains Seroussi. ""That's coming from our world."" Jimenez remembers J Balvin and Nicki Jam telling her that ""reggaeton is the new pop."" ""Latin music is the new mainstream,"" she adds.And reggaeton is just one part of that â€“ since Latin trap shares its rhythmic underpinnings with a large swathe of contemporary hip-hop, Spanish-language MCs are poised become an increasingly prominent part of the ever-expanding rap landscape as well. Like reggaetoneros, American rappers are fond of collaboration, so American and Latin trap are already intermingling. The week of December 16th, a remix of Farruko's ""Krippy Krush"" featuring Nicki Minaj and 21 Savage was added into rotation by 14 mainstream hip-hop stations; Post Malone recently recruited Ozuna and Nicky Jam for a remix of his Number One hit ""Rockstar.""&nbsp;Executives say many more of these collaborations are in the works for 2018, and Sony Latin is planning to release an entire compilation pairing English and Latin acts. ""You're not talking about a fluke or a flavor of the month or 'this is cute for now' like it was back in the 1990s,"" Seroussi asserts. ""Our music is a part of the vocabulary of the mainstream world, and now the sky's the limit.""At least until another major, previously neglected music market gets connected to the global grid. ""I think [Latin music] will be very dominant for the next couple years,"" LÃ_pez says. ""After, that you need to see how the development in Asia effects these charts. The revolution is coming.""For Danny Ocean, the revolution is already here: In Mexico, Colombia and Chile, ""Me RehÃºso"" ended up even more popular than ""Despacito,"" and earlier this month, Spotify announced that Ocean's single passed ""Despacito"" as the Spanish-language song with the most week on the Global Top 50 chart. ""We're gonna start seeing the same pattern over and over with other songs,"" Guerrero says. Except a few years from now, she predicts that a fast-rising track like ""Me RehÃºso"" will be in Arabic or Mandarin.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,Sarah  Grant,2017-11-28T17:46:00.000Z,"Dan Deacon on Music From Rats' Brains, His Wild Aerosmith Mashup","dan deacon, dan deacon new music, dan deacon rat film, rat film, dan deacon baltimore, dan deacon gliss riffer, miley cyrus, under armour, rat film soundtrack,",Rolling Stone,"""Everywhere I go in the world, people are like, 'Ohhhh, whoa, Baltimore. The Wire,'"" Dan Deacon&nbsp;tells Rolling Stone&nbsp;from his house in Charm City. ""I can't imagine meeting someone from New York and being like, 'Oh, New York? Friends. Seinfield. Preeeetty cool. How do you like it there?'"" The 36-year-old electronic musician takes Baltimore's reputation to heart, because while David Simon made the city a place people came to fear, Deacon made it a place people came to party.Ever since Deacon's 2007 breakout LP&nbsp;Spiderman of the Rings,&nbsp;his late-night raves in decrepit Baltimore lofts have become the stuff of underground legend. Deacon plays right on the floor, standing over a thicket of cables, a laptop illuminating his owlish glasses. Atmospheric&nbsp;as a Rothko, insane as&nbsp;Looney Tunes, his music is an improbably danceable cacophony of synths, MIDI samples and more strung together by slivers of pop and noise.&nbsp;These days, in addition to his regular haunts, he brings his inventive compositions to esteemed venues like Carnegie Hall and the New York City Ballet at Lincoln Center. Plus a few unlikely ones, like Miley Cyrus' Dead Petz Tour.&nbsp;Deacon's career has mirrored the eccentric turns of his music. This year, he scored&nbsp;Rat Film, a cerebral indie documentary that traces Baltimore's socioeconomic problems through its history of rat infestations. ""I knew this film was going to be covering institutional racism and rampant, rampant â€“ basically designed â€“ poverty, but it wasn't going to be sensationalized,"" Deacon says. ""That got me excited.""&nbsp;While his creative stature rises, Deacon remains deeply passionate about his home city, where he's resided for 13 years. The first bit of money he ever made, he says, from Spiderman, went into&nbsp;renovating a derelict building near the center of the city to create a DIY space for artists to live and work. Last year, police evicted and closed the Bell Foundry after a city-wide crackdown following the Ghost Ship fire in Oakland that killed 36 people. Deacon was then invited to join Baltimore's new special task force for such spaces, like the one he founded.One of the first pieces of yours I heard was this feedback-laden collage of Aerosmith's&nbsp;Permanent Vacation from around 2002. Why that album?[Laughs] Aerosmith was my first favorite band. What I loved was, you hear ""Dream On"" and then you hear another song and it's like, ""Who is this new singer?"" And Permanent Vacation really embodies that. This is going back 15 years. I was listening to Stockhausen, John Cage, heady noise music like Prurient. And then I'd go back and listen to Aerosmith's ""Rag Doll."" I was thinking about how insane it was â€“ the pageantry, the fanfare of their shows, the scarves. Then I thought, ""What if there were hundreds of Aerosmiths â€“ playing all of Aerosmith's music?"" I understand ""permanent vacation"" is a prison reference, but I loved the concept of all Aerosmith, all the time, forever. So I layered the guitars and staggered their references â€“ like putting all the middle points in the same spot.A lot of people wouldn't even admit to owning that CD.Most people didn't get down with Aerosmith the same way I did. My parents listened to classic rock, but not them. So Aerosmith became mine in a way.Have you ever been to an Aerosmith concert?They was my first concert! I was in junior high and it was the Jones Beach Amphitheater. Collective Soul opened. My dad got the tickets for my birthday. I remember we rushed down to get there because we thought our tickets were for the other night [laughs]. I can't really relate to my youth mindset and I don't know why I made that track. But I still love the way that it ends on that vamping vocal harmonica jam. Where they end is where they're no longer present in the piece.You seem to be drawn to creating unreal textures from ordinary sources, like with Rat Film, where you used the sounds of rats in the score. Where did you get that idea?I had a teacher in college, Joel Thome, who did a piece where he put different bugs on an overhead projector. As the bugs swooped around, the performers would change what they were playing based on the coordinates of [his or her] assigned bug. That always resonated with me. I kept thinking, ""What do rats do?"" I have three theremins. When you put them close enough to each other, they interact on their own. So we decided to make this triangle enclosure out of my theremins for the rats.Where did you get the rats?My friend who lived down the street had two pet rats. They were the stars. As the rat moved from one theremin to the next, one would get higher in pitch and the other would get lower in pitch and the third would have this really odd wavering sound. We converted most of that voltage to MIDI â€“ this arcane language I love that I pray to God they update (it's been in version 1.0 since the Seventies). I came up with the piano sections, but the rhythmic content is devised by rats. And if you hear a pop, those pops are a rat's hippocampus being triggered.How did you get sound out of a rat's brain?[Rat Film director] Theo Anthony gave me a long recording of rat brain impulses from using electrodes and different stimuli to track rats' behaviors, dreams and responses. The recording was converted to sound, slowed way down, like 1,000 percent. Then, I slowed it down an additional 1,000 percent to get less of a purr and more of the tickitoo tickitoo rhythms. Some of the haunting, airy sounds are a combination of the two.What's your opinion of rats in general?They're chill little creatures. I'm sure if one were in my house right now, I'd be like, ""That is a huge animal and it doesn't have logic and it's hungry!"" But right now, I'm staring at a bunch of bees inside my house. I've had bees for the past four years now and I love them [laughs]. I don't want to disturb them. They're like my little pets. I don't know. Both my parents were exterminators.Did you ever go on any jobs with them as a kid?Yeah, it was a small, two-person company they ran together called Deacon's Professional Pest Management. They ran it out of the house. One of them was always on the phone talking to a customer saying things like, ""A mouse can fit through any hole, even the size of a dime, the rat a quarter"" [laughs]. My dad really cherished life and saw the absurd nature of life through his job. I remember going on jobs with him where he'd catch a squirrel or a raccoon â€“ which, I believe, the state forces you to kill â€“ and we would just go to the state parks and let them loose. It didn't make any sense to kill this animal that hadn't really done anything wrong. I often think about how we're probably more a giant inconvenience for the rats than vice versa. The rats were probably like [mimics a rat voice], ""This was a pretty chill, swampy marsh before someone brought all these rocks here and dried it out. What the hell is this?""Rat Film&nbsp;uses the city's rat infestation to touch on a number of the city's deep-seated issues, from urban-planning failures to systemic racism. Are the rats symbolic of poverty in Baltimore?I think Theo is trying to depict the opposite. I don't think he is ever trying to use the rat as a metaphor for poverty or people. It's easy to make that correlation because of the way history has trained us to. [Authorities] have done that for a very deliberate reason. It's to dehumanize people.That really comes across when present-day Baltimore is shown in warped Google Earth images. What did you want the score to reflect in those sections?I wanted something that leaves you hanging, that never resolves. I thought about how there are so many details in Google Earth, but they're all corrupted or odd and it's moving at such an unnatural rate, so I thought a synthetic instrument like brass would work. Like, there's no way those horns sound like real horns, just as there's no way someone could see Google Earth and be like, ""What a beautiful photograph. What camera did you take it with?""The only actual song in the doc is Ed Schrader's anthem ""Rats,""&nbsp;which really hits home when you have a rodent problem.[Laughs] Back then Ed lived with my girlfriend at the time in the Copycat [apartment building]&nbsp;and I lived in the unit across the hall. Ed would come in and drive me fucking crazy [laughs]. Anyway, I remember the first time he played [""Rats""] he used just a CD rack with contact mics. It had this really wild sound, because of all these different sheets of metal. He was just banging on them with scissors â€“ like one half of a scissor in each hand. I remember thinking about those lyrics and he was like, ""Yeah, I was just laying here on the floor and saw five rats going in and out of my kitchen and realized they're probably crawling all over me when I'm sleeping."" And I was like, ""Huh, I guess me too.""After the Ghost Ship fire, Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh tapped you to serve on a new task force aimed at making DIY arts spaces safer. What's been your experience so far?On paper, [the task force] could have been amazing. I think it was a well-intentioned idea. But there was a lot more politics involved than concern [for safety] ... if the city or fire department wants you out, you're out. At one time, I thought I had a mind for politics. I tried to make the meetings as public as possible, and then eventually stopped getting emails about when they were. I also don't think DIY spaces are a topic for the press or for the boardroom. People who have never walked into a DIY space are now talking about the need to preserve them? What do they think they are trying to preserve?What do you make of Under Armour's multibillion-dollar real estate investment in downtown Baltimore that was announced this year?Ever seen RoboCop? It's like that scene where the seemingly well-meaning corporation wants to build a new city. Personally, I'm horrified of a ""new Baltimore"" and the insane compound city [Under Armour] is going to build. If it's a success, then Baltimore will become like Portland and most of my friends won't be able to afford to live here.We've put all our chips in Under Armour â€“ the largest sum of money the city has ever given to any project. But there's still no infrastructure for it here; it's all still post-industrial, so we'd need all new roads, street lights â€“ those sort of things. That's the part that shows the city's true colors. I understand wanting to bring in new industry, new jobs â€“ but the amount of attention this project gets in comparison to existing issues ... I don't have a problem with a company being large. But one company acting like it's the only thing here? It's a wealth duel that the people are going to lose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,Andy Greene,2017-12-13T13:06:00.000Z,Moody Blues' Justin Hayward on Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Honor: 'It's Amazing!',"Moody Blues, Moody Blues Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Justin Hayward Interview, Justin Hayward Hall of Fame, hall of fame 2017, rock & roll hall of fame list, rock and roll hall of fame 2018, nights in white satin, moody blues songs, complete hall of fame",Rolling Stone,"Up until the moment he learned the Moody Blues were entering the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, frontman Justin Hayward spent almost no time thinking about the institution. ""On Friday, I couldn't have cared less,"" he says. ""On Saturday, when I found out we were in, I was thinking, 'Wow, this is amazing!' But I'm still a committed European. I sometimes wish I was an American and could get really excited about it."" But he's still excited enough to plan a trip to Cleveland in April for the ceremony, which could include a reunion with his former bandmates Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder. We spoke with Hayward about the honor, his thoughts on his fellow inductees and their hysterical guest spot on The Simpsons in 1999. Congratulations! How do you feel?I want to start off by saying this is the first time that Rolling Stone is calling me in 51 years. [Laughs] That was the first thing I thought. I'm sitting here with my engineer and I said, ""Rolling Stone is going to call me?""Better late than never. How did you find out the big news?I found out from our agent at CAA.What does it mean to you on a personal level?Hey listen, I'm extremely grateful to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame for two things: For creating the supreme temple to something that has brought me endless joy since I was a little boy. The second thing is that after all these years they are including us. That's about it. That's how I feel about it.Why do you think it took so long?I don't know. I'm the last person to really be able to answer that. I'm not there. I don't know what goes into it. You'd know better than I would. Is it down to people's taste? Why does it take some groups so long?I think it's just the taste of a bunch of people sitting in a room together. They tend to gravitate&nbsp;towards critical favorites and away from metal and anything associated with prog rock.Well, they have a duty to be inclusive and not exclusive. But we are there in the frame now. I don't quite know how to explain it.I think it's partially since you've always been more of a fan's band than a critic's band.That's fair. Me personally and the group as well, in its early days, we were lucky to be able to go our own way and not chase a hit. Along the way, we made some not-great records because we didn't have an A&amp;R guy standing over us. I think that's a great thing. We were able to be self-indulgent and trust our own judgement.You never lost your fan base.Particularly in the 1980s, they kind of embraced what the critics maybe didn't embrace, which was ""Your Wildest Dreams"" and ""I Know You're Out There Somewhere."" I met Tony Visconti at the BBC and we started looking at songs in a different way and the success we had in the 1980s brought us a whole new fan base that's still with us now.Did you often hear from fans about their frustration regarding the Hall of Fame?You're kidding. It was HUGE. I'm English and I live in Europe. I'm in Genoa at a studio and am kind of immune to it. Nobody really knows about the Hall of Fame here, but there's almost a sense of, ""How dare they have their own Hall of Fame? It should be the world's Hall of Fame."" It's like the World Series with baseball or somethingâ€_I probably just said the wrong thing, but you get the gist of what I mean. The thanks really goes to the Moody Blues fans for giving us such a wonderful life of music.It must be a thrill to be in the same club as Buddy Holly, the Beatles, Elvis Presleyâ€_Yeah. I thought about that just a few minutes ago. It's a privilege to be celebrated, on the same street even, as my own heroes: Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers. Now at last, my heroine, Nine Simone. She's the woman that kind of taught me how to sing, really. That's a privilege to me, to be celebrated in the same town as Buddy and the Everly Brothers and Nina Simone.Let's talk about some of the other inductees. Along with Nina Simone, there's also Dire Straits. Are you a fan?Of course. Is Mark [Knopfler] in there already solo?No. This is his first time getting in.That's astounding.The Cars.They are such a part of musical history that was really defined by that [first] record of theirs. It reached everywhere, even Africa, Europe and Asia. That was a curious thing.How about Bon Jovi?I don't actually know much about Bon Jovi, but I know they are huge. I can't really tell you about them.Inductees tend to play three songs. Any idea what three songs you'll want to do that night?I would hope we do ""Nights [In White Satin]."" Well, I've got one on the list.Can you think of a song that would work for the all-star jam you could play with the other inductees?Would do people usually play? ""Johnny B. Goode"" or another Chuck Berry tune?Yeah. It's often a cover like that.I think we'd have to play homage to our heroes, either Buddy [Holly] or Chuck Berry.Do you think former Moody Blues member Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder are going to come?I don't know about that. When you leave a group it's because you don't want to be in it. I miss them both, particularly Mike Pinder because he was the guy that brought me into the group.Are you open to the idea of performing with them at the ceremony?Sure.The fans would love that.Yeah. I think the spirit is always willing.Do you keep in touch with them?No. I saw Mike a couple of years ago. He came to a gig in California and we had a hug. That was great. But no, I don't keep in touch with them, no. It doesn't tend to be like that. It's like seeing a school friend. ""How are you? What have you been doing for the past 30 years?""I'm sure it'll be emotional to shake their hands and stand with them at the podium.That will be absolutely wonderful. Of course it would. I'm aware that we're probably getting this award for the first 20 years, not for the last 30. You know what I mean?Sure. I think some people will wonder why Denny Laine wasn't inducted. Do you have any thoughts on that?I don't really. There's [original singer] Denny Laine and Clint [Warwick], the original bassist who was kind of forgotten. More importantly, I would have thought that Denny would have been inducted with Wings.They just brought in Paul [McCartney] solo.Denny did write his share of ""Mull of Kintyre.""Do you view that first Moody Blues record as almost the work of a different band?&nbsp;Yes. The one thing I remember, again, is Mike Pinder. The first incarnation was together for such a short time and was defined by that one record, ""Go Now."" It was a wonderful recording, and so was the original by Bessie Banks that was superb with the same arrangements. I came to the group really as a songwriter and I was lousy with that stuff. The other guys didn't want to know about singing ""Go Now,"" so they were like ""you better do it"" when I came in. So I had to sing it for a couple of months and I was absolutely lousy at rhythm and blues, so it was my purpose to get my own songs done. It was Mike Pinder's purpose as well. Things had to change. The blue suits and the R&amp;B set was getting us nowhere. ""Go Now,"" for me, was one of those classic records of the mid-1960s.Have you sang it since your earliest months in the band?No. I don't particularly want to sing it ever again!The timing of the induction is pretty good since you're in the middle of your Days of Future Passed tour.Yeah, that's been absolutely wonderful. I wonder if it influenced anybody? I don't know. It's been a wonderful thing to celebrate, that's for sure.The ceremony will be in Cleveland. Do you have fond memories of playing there?Sure. Of course. I played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame quite a few times. One was for the Amazon Conservation Association. I understand that that organization is separate from the group that nominates acts. But Cleveland, we first came there was an opening act for Canned Heat in 1968.I think your fans are going to be so happy this is finally happening. They've been petitioning forever.I'm so, so pleased for them. This induction is validating the music they really, really love. I'm so pleased for all of them, for us, for me, for my wife, everything. It's just great.Just a couple of random questions. Your appearance on The Simpsons is one of my favorite guest spots they ever had. What are your memories of recording that?Matt Groening got in touch with us and I had a short communication with him. I was interested in the reason behind it. As you said, we've never been that critically acclaimed. He said, ""Homer has always a more interesting character than Bart and we decided he's a Moody Blues fan."" We were playing up in Canada somewhere and they fixed a recording session for us to with Matt and the people at a studio in L.A. by ISDN line. They gave us the words to say, not the whole story, just ""say this."" I was thrilled with my little bit. One of the guys said, ""I'm not sure I like my words."" It wasn't me. And so Matt said to this guy, ""You can do it, or you can not do it."" They were then like, ""Oh, okay, right.""My daughter was at UCLA for a year doing American studies. She did no work since she was years ahead of all the American students. But she saw it first on the TV and said, ""I just saw you on The Simpsons."" I said, ""What do I look like?"" She said, ""Yellow."" It's all primary colors. When I saw it, I knew what she meant.The X-Men movie of a few years ago was called Days of Future Past, which is obviously very similar to your album Days of Future Passed. Did they ask permission or anything?No. That was a curious thing.How did you feel about that?Is it too much of a coincidence that they could think of that and not know that there was a group somewhere out there that made an album called that? What do you think?I think they must have known.I think that question was posed to somebody in the production of the movie and I think it was denied, but it's like a phrase that goes into the language somehow. I sometimes pick up a newspaper and there's a lingerie section in the woman's section and you flip through it and its called Nights In White Satin. There's no credit for it. It's just a phrase. Maybe that's what this was. It's nice, anyway. It brought a lot of questions from our fans, but we had nothing to do with it.Thanks for doing this. Again, congrats. It's long overdue.My pleasure. Rolling Stone called me!&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,Brittany Spanos,2017-12-21T18:16:22.187Z,Why Don't We: Meet the Band Who Want to Be the Next 'N Sync,"Why Don't We, Zach Herron, Corbyn Besson, Jack Avery, Jonah Marais, Daniel Seavey, boy bands, why don't we songs, one direction, why don't we boys names",Rolling Stone,"""Guys, can we cheers again?"" asks Zach Herron for the umpteenth time. The giggling 16-year-old is in the middle of directing a intricate Instagram story, in which his Why Donâ€™t We bandmates hold up matching mugs of hot chocolate at a restaurant a few blocks away from&nbsp;Live With Kelly and Ryan,&nbsp;where they just performed their sugary singles ""These Girls"" and ""Something Different.â€ù Herron's bandmates, the blonde Corbyn Besson and curley-haired Jack Avery, both 18, begrudgingly oblige, and Herron posts it as a story to Why Don't We's 2.1 million Instagram followers. The process becomes more complex as an irreverent short film emerges, soon involving 18-year-old Daniel Seavey, who had already posted a photo of 19-year-old Jonah Marais, who calls himself the group ""dad"" based off his barely older age and generally more coolheaded demeanor â€” sipping his coffee off to the side.This may seem like a mundane exercise, but the band knows it's important work. Despite forming a little over a year ago, their social media mastery has allowed them to bypass typical paths to teen stardom â€“ such as having a Disney channel show â€“ and become ridiculously popular, with 105 million YouTube views (""These Girlsâ€ù has earned over 30 million) and 90 million audio streams. So far they've released five EPs, recently breaking into the Billboard 200 with September's&nbsp;Invitation. ""We really caught on at the right time,"" Avery says. The ""right time"" is a social media moment about 10 years in the making, spearheaded by young stars showing off their musical and performance talents through Vine, Instagram, Musical.ly and other video engagement apps that have has become popular since YouTube kicked the phenomenon off. By the time the group leaves today, the Instagram story has been posted in full by multiple fan accounts, and some selfie-seeking fans have found their breakfast location. More teenage girls greet them later at the Hudson Hotel, some bearing gifts to the bandthat relate to fandom inside jokes â€” like gum for Avery, who has tweeted about how much he loves chewing it.Before they formed, most members of Why Don't We already had fans. &nbsp;Besson and Marais were live streaming their home performances on platforms like YouNow, sometimes for audiences as large as 60,000 at once who would tune in to watch the teens croon. Herron's posted a cover of Shawn Mendes' ""Stitches"" on Instagram that earned 20 million views when cross-posted to Facebook. Avery covered Ed Sheeran's catalog for his personal YouTube page. Seavey, who plays several instruments, was the only one to gain his platform from national television â€” a once untraditional mode of launching a career now made to feel quaintly old school â€” when he placed in the Top Seven on on American Idol.â€œAnd then I joined Impact, a meet-and-greet tour,"" Herron recalls. Meet-and-greet tours like 2016's Impact brought them around the country, while putting an emphasis on the fans, giving them a chance to meet young musicians, comedians and general internet-famous personalities. Content creators would visit major US cities to sing, dance and get one-on-one face time with their budding fandoms. ""And that was where I was like 'OK, I am going to start performing in front of screaming girls,'"" Herron says.&nbsp;The other members followed, befriending each other in the process. Jon Lucero, the founder of meet-and-greet tour Brave Fest, saw a new kind of potential. ""I thought about how there hasn't been a great American boy band since 'N Sync,â€ù he says. &nbsp;Lucero started talking with Avery and his mother about forming a group. He also touched base regularly with the four other future members.  ""They always answered my calls,"" he says. ""I said 'Guys, don't sign anything crazy before you speak to me because I feel like something's going to happen.' They stayed loyal."" In September 2016, Lucero had the boys flown out to Los Angeles where they officially became Why Don't We. The impulsive career shift even inspired their name. ""We were chilling and singing together and it made sense: Why don't we make this a thing?"" Marais says of their first LA hang. ""I never thought I would be in a boy band to be honest,"" Herron admits.&nbsp;Marais chimes in: â€ùI secretly wanted to be in one, not gonna lie.â€ùNext, they met David Loeffler and Randy Phillips, two industry vets and old friends of Lucero who became their managers (Lucero remains on the team as tour manager). Two months after forming, they released their debut EP Only the Beginning. It kicked off a unique strategy: While it's not unusual for a new artist to test the waters with one or two EPs ahead of an album, the five total (including a recent Christmas EP) they have released in their first year of existence is a new kind of prolific. But it's worked: in June, they were signed by Atlantic Records, which will release their debut album.&nbsp;Over the past year, Why Don't We have been living out of suitcases, spending little time in the L.A. house they moved into together. All the recording, filming and touring means that they only pass through their hometowns â€” they each hail from different corners of the country, including Pennsylvania, Oregon and Texas â€” when the road takes them there.&nbsp;""It's definitely weird,"" Marais says of his new lifestyle. He had left high school early while pursuing his solo career a few years back and got a GED per his parents' request. ""I'm single but I just wonder if I was doing the normal thing and in college, I would probably have a girlfriend. It's a totally different road.""""I definitely miss just hanging with friends, coming home from school and getting homework out of the way quickly so you can just hang out the rest of the night,"" says Besson, the only member sustaining a long-distance relationship. Seavey quickly jumps in to add some levity. ""As a solo artist, it would probably be so much harder."" All day, the band are overwhelmingly polite to each other  â€“ each member is quick to compliment each other's abilities and  achievements, whether it's Avery and Herron's vocal abilities, Marais' astounding following as a solo artist, Seavey's polymath musicianship or even Besson's success at maintaining his relationship while on the road. Next year, Why Don't We will prepare their debut album and embark on largely sold-out tour. They will have competition with other boy bands gunning to the void left by One Direction's split last year, Simon Cowell's new group, PrettyMuch, and K-pop hitmakers BTS, both of whom are prepping for big career moves in 2018. Why Don't We aren't worried. ""If the product is good, people will love it no matter what,"" says Lucero. ""If you think about it, back when 'NSYNC and Backstreet Boys were going, you had 98 Degrees, LFO and a bunch of different groups in America alone who were out at the same time and all successful. There's millions of people out in the world and the market is huge."" Curve Records CEO Steve Greenberg, who discovered Hanson and the Jonas Brothers, agrees. ""There's always space for a new boy band,"" he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,Rolling Stone,2017-11-17T17:08:00.000Z,Simple Plan's Pierre Bouvier: Warped Tour Was 'an Experience Like No Other',"simple plan, simple plan warped tour, simple plan rolling stone, pierre bouvier, pierre bouvier interview, pierre bouvier rolling stone, simple plan pop-punk, warped tour, blink-182 warped tour",Rolling Stone,"Since the Nineties, Vans Warped Tour has been a constant, integral part of Pierre Bouvier's life. He played the tour a few times with Reset, and later, with bandmate Chuck Comeau, formed Simple Plan. Warped Tour helped Simple Plan not only find their footing in the early Aughts but has remained a way for the group to stay connected with their heroes, friends and fans with over 10 years of playing the tour.&nbsp;Following news that Vans Warped Tour would cease to exist following the 2018 trek, Bouvier spoke with Rolling Stone&nbsp;about his personal history with founder Kevin Lyman and the Warped community, as well as the state of the scene the festival brought to prominence.When we first played Warped Tour with Simple Plan, I already had a lot of experience with Warped Tour on my own, just attending and being part of it with other bands.&nbsp;I remember playing the Toronto show, and our way of doing it was super DIY. We went around the entire crowd all day along with a couple Walkmans to play our five-song demo. We'd walk up to people and say ""Hey do you want to hear some music? We're playing at 1 o'clock at whatever-stage-we're playing-at."" We would go out and recruit fans one-on-one. It was this one time a year where all us like-minded punk rock and pop-punk fans would get to see each other, meet each other and be around people who were similar to us outside our friends and bandmates. We would realize in each city that there were so many people who enjoy Blink-182 and Green Day and Face to Face and Offspring and Pennywise and all these cool bands you don't see on MTV or hear on the radio.Of course, this was a time before social media exploded. Being able to tap into something like that was a lot harder. It wasn't like we could press a button on our phone and find each other. You had to find these alternative music stores or go to Warped Tour and get a glimpse of who these bands were and what this culture was like. It was a really special time of year when these bands came around.Either the year before or after we played for the first time as Simple Plan, Chuck and I attended Warped as fans. Because of our experiences with our previous plan, we had a relationship with some of the guys from Blink-182 since we had played some shows together. I know that Chuck had hung out with Mark [Hoppus] quite a bit. I think it was at the Toronto Warped Tour we basically waited outside their tour bus for them to emerge so we can possibly intercept them and play them our newest demo we had recorded in Montreal. That was how you did it back then: you would find bands you liked and play them your song.&nbsp;I have a vivid memory of being outside Blink's tour bus, hoping they would come out so we could say hi. I remember feeling so stupid and thinking ""Man, what are we doing here? They don't want to talk to us!"" Chuck was like ""No, man! I know Mark, and he'll be happy to see me!"" So we waited for hours, and they finally come out and we pass along the demo. That demo had an early version of the song ""I'd Do Anything,"" which ended up being our second single off our first album. Mark really loved the demo and started corresponding with Chuck. Then we thought it would be the coolest thing as little pop-punk boys from Montreal to ask Mark if he would sing on the song, which he ended up doing. Basically the Warped Tour is a huge factor in how the band got some notoriety and excitement and hype around it. It ended up being a big hit for us.That vibe was really important. Everyone is the same on Warped. All the tour buses are parked together. Everybody eats the same catering. It allows people to hopefully catch a glimpse of their musical heroes. I think for a lot of our fans and fellow bands, we've always been considered on the poppier side of Warped Tour. We've had a lot of mainstream success and radio support, and there are a lot of people who may not be hardcore Warped Tour fans who may know our band that heard our songs. But it was always important for us to remain part of that scene and not just be an MTV pop-punk band. This tour is where our music started, and where we as fans started. It's important for us to keep being part of it. We've always made a conscious effort to go, even though there were some years it financially didn't make much sense to do Warped Tour; because there's so many bands, it's not a huge moneymaker for anybody. We could've taken more lucrative offers somewhere else, but it was important for us to go play â€“ and possibly lose some money but to connect with our fans. [Playing] the Warped Tour as a band is an experience like no other. It's like going to summer camp. Kevin Lyman [Warped Tour's founder] and his team really handpicked bands that are part of a style. If you like Green Day, Blink-182, Simple Plan or Good Charlotte and so many other bands, you're probably going to like the band playing on any stage. That's what cool â€“&nbsp; it gives an opportunity to bands in this style ... they could expose their music to a potential crowd that already kind of likes the style that they're doing. Also, it didn't always work the way Kevin envisioned it, but it kept bands humble. If you went on Warped Tour and thought you were cool but acted like a dick or above everyone else, there's a chance you might get kicked off the tour. There was even a year that I believe Alien Ant Farm had a bit of an attitude when their Michael Jackson cover was blowing up and got kicked off the tour because of it. It's humbling, and at the time could've been frustrating. You can go see someone who is on the verge like Katy Perry, Sugar Ray or even Eminem ... on a small stage at a random time, and it'll be chaos and mayhem. That was part of the magic.For us, we played Warped in 2002 and it was right when No Pads, No Helmetsâ€_Just Balls came out and we started blowing up. Our pay on that tour was peanuts â€” maybe $200, $300 a day â€” and we were playing a small stage that could barely accommodate the crowds coming to see us. At the end of the tour, Kevin asked us to do it the following year and we agreed to a $500 a day contract for 2003. As that year progressed, we became so huge with a platinum record and everything blowing up. We came back to Kevin and said we needed more money, and he said ""Nope! We agreed on a handshake for $500."" At the time it was so frustrating. We were one of the biggest bands on the bill and were getting paid shit. Looking back, it's part of the mentality.That's what is cool about it. You can go see someone who is on the verge like Katy Perry, Sugar Ray or even Eminem. You can see them on a small stage at a random time, and it'll be chaos and mayhem. That was part of the magic. We're all the same, and now that we know Kevin a little better, I do think that's what he was trying to achieve: not to create a bunch of asshole rock stars. I think some people took it the wrong way, but I get it.But Warped Tour was part of a generation. Over the last five years, it's not as tightknit and genre-specific as it used to be. Back in 2000, all the bands on Warped had a similar sound, where now, and because it's only normal that music is evolving and changing, there's a lot more things. From electronic music to people like Machine Gun Kelly and Twenty One Pilots. It's no longer just bands playing guitars and drums and rocking out. It wasn't sustainable as it once was anymoreIt's going to have to be replaced by something, one way or another. I think it's a shame that something like that can't keep going and exist and be a place for people to exist and discover new things outside of their phone or social media or Spotify. Then again, that's where the future is going. That's evolution and how our parents feel about us and how we're gonna feel about our kids. It's a shame that that this style and culture can't sustain itself as it used to. There will always be alternative styles and music and cultures. By the time my kids are in high school, I'm sure there will be things they love that will make me go ""What the hell is this?"" For them, that will be their Warped Tour.Even the style of music that Vans Warped Tour represented at the beginning and even halfway through, I don't know that that style of music will get a lot of new pioneers. I don't know if there will be another Blink-182. There will be other people who are alternative and different, but all the pop-punk pioneers are doing things that are nothing like what they used to do. Is it because they got bored of it? Have all those bases been covered? Have all those songs been written? I don't know.&nbsp;As told to Brittany Spanos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,Elias Leight,2018-02-02T15:36:48.621Z,Viral Best Buy 'Sauce' Guy Talks Being Sampled on Justin Timberlake's 'Man of the Woods',Sauce,Rolling Stone,"On ""Sauce,"" the third track of Justin Timberlake's just-released Man in the Woods, the pop superstar cedes the spotlight, letting a collaborator give a lesson in rhetoric. A philosophical gem comes courtesy of 21-year-old Gordon Terry, star of viral video clip explaining the difference between ""the juice"" and ""the sauce"" â€“ a slang term popularized by rapper Gucci Mane.""Juice is temporary,"" he explains in the video, sampled at the beginning of Timberlake's ""Sauce."" ""You could say that just 'cause you got a nice car or something, like, 'Aw, man, he got the juice' ... it's something that kind of comes and goes. But the sauce: Sauce is forever."" Terry's friend recorded the video while the two were working at a Best Buy in Indiana. The viral success of the clip spurred Terry to move to San Diego where he is focusing on building his career as a social media influencer. ""It feels like a movie,"" he says. ""Someone is writing my life right now, and I'm loving it."" Terry spoke with Rolling Stone about how he ended up on Man in the Woods and why Timberlake has the sauce.How did you initially go viral?My friend Luke, who recorded the video, he was talking and I was like, ""Hey man, I've watched you grow up a little bit. â€_ You had the juice, I think you might have the sauce now."" He got out of a bad relationship and he was flourishing. He wasn't buying gifts for someone that doesn't appreciate him. I was like, Look at you glowing out here! You ain't got pimples no more. Your bank account's fat. Your grades are right! You're moving to the sauce. You got that untouchable aura around you right now.He didn't understand what I was saying, so I had to educate him real quickly and let him know the difference between the juice and the sauce. He thought that was hilarious, so he said, ""Let me go ahead and record this, and I'm gonna show my dad and let him know the difference."" I was explaining it to another co-worker at the same time as he was recording it so he could show his dad. He keeps that video posted on his Twitter and his Instagram. Unfortunately the Twitter count reset. It was at like 10 million views. Now it's at two million. So I don't know what the real number is. But an hour after he posted it, it had 300 to 400 retweets, and by the time we woke up, it was in the 10,000s. It was literally overnight, because we did it at work â€“ we almost got fired for it â€“ and once we got off, he posted it. Why did you almost get fired?We were on the clock in our uniforms on video, which is extremely against the rules. But we had a really slow store. â€_ Management called down and were like, ""You can't have employees doing this, they signed a waiver, we're supposed to fire them."" But Best Buy was cool enough at the time to let it slide. Every time that video was posted, the replies were like, ""Of course he works at Best Buy, only the smartest and nicest people work there."" It brought them a lot of really good light. I'm not saying I made Best Buy a bunch of money, I'm just saying their stock went up 26 cents that night.What kind of offers were you getting for the video?I had a bunch of companies trying to purchase the video outright. A bunch of the offers I felt disrespected by. I'm an amateur video person, but art is more than a number or a price. If someone hits me up like, ""I'll post your video on my website for 50 bucks and you just give me all the rights to the video for the rest of your life,"" I'm gonna say no. I'd rather not sell the video and have it then take your 50 bucks that's gonna be gone. That's not even juice. That's water, dawg.When did you find out you were going to be sampled by Justin Timberlake?I'm not gonna lie, the last few months have been the longest months of my life. I want to say we found out end of summer, middle of fall. We had the wait through fall; now we're deep into winter. I've been clawing my hair out â€“ the anticipation is killing me. I kind of reminds me of those guys from YouTube, the 4YallEntertainment guys in Canada who got sampled by Drake [on ""Madiba Riddim""]. They had to chill the whole time, and once it came out they dropped their Vlog of them playing it. I'm doing the same thing. I'm in Cali, so the actual album will be released at 9 here. I'm going to be turnt, driving around listening to my voice.Did a lawyer from Timberlake's camp reach out to you?They tracked me down. When I say they tracked me down â€“ I didn't have any information up on my Twitter, my Instagram. It just said Indiana, but it didn't say Terra Haute. The only thing I can think is they went to my Twitter, saw it said Indiana, called the call center and tried to find out my employee number or store location. They called my manager, and he hit me up like, ""This guy from a record company, the president, is looking for you."" I'm like, ""huh?"" Shout out to Andre Person from Tennman Records. He's like, ""Justin loves the clip, he wants to use it on the song."" I said, ""I don't know who you are, but stop playing on my phone."" You're talking about me being on a Timberlake song. That's unreal.How did he convince you he was real?I did not believe it until my checking account believed it. We worked out a wonderful deal. I didn't give over the whole thing. That video means a lot to me. It's something I can have the rest of my life â€“ talk to my kids, my grandkids: Hey, this person you probably don't listen to because you're one year old, I know them.Have you heard the song that contains the sample?Nope. I really want to wait until the song comes out. Videotape me unwrapping it, finding my name, going, ""Oh this is my song,"" skipping all the songs and going straight to mine because I'm selfish. I'll give the album a good listen after I listen to my song about 30 times.Did Andre tell you how Justin found the video?As I understand it, they were in the studio and they were well into the song. While they were chilling, somebody saw the video on their phone. I don't know who it was in the room. But they were like, bro, this is literally perfect. We need to find this person. They said it took them about two or three days. That's how I know it's important â€“ that they really want it. They took their time out, like, hey man, your job for the next couple days is to find where this person lives and call him.Are you a JT fan?Am I a JT fan?! Do I have ears? Justin Timberlake is excellent. I think he's incredibly underrated. This is his fourth solo studio album â€“ how do you have that much behind you with only four albums? He's been making music since I was a baby. I'm only 21; born in '96. He's been making music for as long as I can remember and he's still relevant with such a low amount of work. He's like the pop AndrÃ© 3000.We have to ask: Does JT have the sauce?Of course he has the sauce. The sauce is the intangibles. It's the things you can't take away from someone. Like an education. My parents always stressed you have to get an education because can't nobody take that from you. That's the sauce. He has the sauce. No one can be out this long doing only this many songs and still sell out arenas and not have the sauce.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,Kory Grow,2018-02-05T16:00:00.000Z,"A Perfect Circle's Maynard James Keenan, Billy Howerdel Talk First LP in 14 Years",a perfect circle,Rolling Stone,"It's been 14 years since A Perfect Circle last put out a new album, and frontman Maynard James Keenan is acutely aware of this fact. So much so that he found himself asking a litany of philosophical questions when making the group's upcoming full-length, Eat the Elephant. ""Do you reinvent yourself and try to look to the future?"" he posits to Rolling Stone. ""Do you do what you did before to satisfy the people who were there before? And when you're no longer 27, are you even relevant? Does it matter? There were many, many questions, and you try not to let them direct everything you're doing, but they were looming.""And how did Keenan reconcile those doubts? ""I just put the blinders on and do it,"" he says. ""I only really truly embraced the things that made sense and inspired me.""What Keenan and his Perfect Circle partner, guitarist Billy Howerdel, made was somewhat of a departure from past albums â€“ a quieter display of the complex emotional tableaus they made their calling card in the early 2000s. Gone largely are the walloping riffs of ""Judith"" and the propulsive rhythms of ""Weak and Powerless."" Eat the Elephant is a moody, sensitive portrait of a band that decided to grow up and make a record that reflects where they are now as artists rather than trying to recapture the past. The group has released two songs from the album so far, the relaxed ""Disillusioned"" (seemingly about a society that's gotten lost in its own self-interest) and ""The Doomed"" (a more upbeat song with lyrics about survival of the fittest).Howerdel first discussed working on the album with Keenan â€“ who splits his time between his other bands Tool and Puscifer, and his winemaking business in Arizona â€“ about a year and a half ago, and from there they just waited for the right chunk of time to focus on it. ""The bottom line is Maynard is a busy guy and when his schedule allows, he knows that I'm going to be interested in making an A Perfect Circle record,"" Howerdel says. ""So he reached out and said he saw a window and that's what we're doing. It was as simple as that."" The guitarist started concentrating on getting the songs together about a year ago and decided to bring in an outside producer, Dave Sardy (Incubus, ZZ Top), for the first time. Howerdel started tracking music last summer; they paused for a brief tour and finally mastered the album in January. ""It's been a furious ending process this winter,"" Howerdel says.Today, the band is officially announcing that the album will be coming out on April 20th, and they've released another single, the swaggering ""TalkTalk,"" which finds Keenan trying unusual new things with his voice as he lambastes falsely self-righteous people in his lyrics.&nbsp;Keenan says the whole process has just been a constant push to the finish line. ""We just had to dig in and do it,"" he says. ""Once the [wine grape] harvest was out of the way, we started to get things done with the music in between picking and processing. It's pretty much been on my plate this whole time."" So he simply sat down and ate the elephant? ""Oh, yeah. One bite at a time.""How did you decide to start working on a new A Perfect Circle album? Maynard Keenan: I had a lot of things I needed to do, but it sounded like things weren't, um, going forward so I had time to shift focus and dabble in something else and see where it would go. With everything I do, there are deadlines for progress. So if I see a spot like, ""Eh, there's just not a lot of movement,"" I'll shift gears.Billy, when did you begin work on the music for the album? Billy Howerdel: God, I don't know. In the Eighties? [Laughs] There's one on this record that's older, but I won't say which one. I would say that 75 percent of them are from the past three years. There's a bunch of songs that didn't make it that I think are really strong and that will leave us open for the future. How did the two of you work out the songs? Keenan: He sent little pieces, maybe 10 or 20 things to start with. Like most guys who play guitar or write music, he had extra time on his hands and was adding things and layering things to the songs. It wasn't until Dave [Sardy], the producer, said, ""Let me just mute all these extra things"" that I heard the song â€“ the drum beat and the melody â€“ and I could hear enough of the song that it leapt forward. Howerdel: Every song is different. You never know how it's going to come out. Some of them come quickly and some are this painful evolution.What song went through a painful evolution? Howerdel: ""TalkTalk"" was a song that was one of my favorites but he wanted to switch the time signature. Originally it was in 4/4 and then it became 3/4. That stumped me for a long time and was painful. It was one of those things where I have to trust when he has an intuition about something. At the end of the day, I'm in service to inspire him and bring his best to the table. Today you put out ""TalkTalk."" What can you say about the creation of that song? Keenan: That one went through a lot of incarnations. It sounded a certain way when I first heard it, but I didn't really hear anything in it. Then Dave and Billy striped some things down, changed tempos and time signatures and I went, ""Oh, there it is"" and latched on.""And a big part of the song is the line, ""Don't be the problem/Be the solution."" Why was that on your mind? Keenan: Just broad strokes. With everything going on nowadays, it's about accountability.Billy, you scored the movie D-love recently. How did that influence what you did with the music on the album? Howerdel: It was very helpful. ""The Contrarian"" and ""The Doomed"" came from that in different forms. The movie had flashbacks to Romania in this girl's childhood and I had to get into that Eastern European mindset and it put me in that place for writing. And with writing, the purpose of writing is in service to the movie and, like I said, with A Perfect Circle I'm trying to get it the best for Maynard in a similar way. Were either of you surprised by the other's approach to songs? Keenan: No, not really. The direction he took was in the way we had been going. I just hear what's there and if I'm not hearing what I think I need to hear I'll have him change the signature or mute everything but the drums or the piano, break it down more. The first three songs on the record are a matter of me erasing or muting instruments or changing tempos, keys and time signatures.Howerdel: ""The Contrarian"" and ""The Doomed"" were both similar in the way they started. On ""The Contrarian,"" I think Maynard heard it much simpler. I wanted to expand that one so I went against what I was feeling, but when I heard his vocal for that song, I was blown away. I don't know that it sounds like Maynard, but it sounds like some of the best Maynard vocals I've ever heard. You could mistake it for someone else for sure.There's a lot to the vocals on the album and not all of it sounds like Maynard. At first I wondered if Billy was singing, too. Howerdel: Yeah. I'll say for the record, Maynard sang every vocal on this record. Before, we'd talked about me doing quite a bit of vocals on the album, but when he started he was on a roll. It's pretty impressive. The range is different, the tonality. But all the chances he took really paid off.Maynard, how has doing Puscifer for a decade changed your approach to singing? Keenan: It's been an education just being a vocalist rather than a barker and paying more attention to harmony, tone and texture. Also it's a band that has a lot more piano and rhythm in addition to guitars so it leaves more space for the vocals to explore, expand and create textures. I'm sure it played into this.Do you feel like you created a continuity within A Perfect Circle's music that stretches the 14-year gap between albums? Keenan: I don't know, because you're in the middle of it. And having done Puscifer for the last 10 years, that's the only perspective I have. So I see connections between those things. I guess if I really step back, I can probably hear connections with older things we've done with A Perfect Circle. There are certainly some nods to what we used to do on ""Delicious"" and ""By and Down the River.""Did it feel like it had been 14 years to you when you started working on this?  Keenan: I feel like I'm kind of like a dog. You could be gone for a day or an hour and I'm going to be happy to see you minutes later. My attention span isn't that developed. I would hope at least the album feels cohesive.How did you approach the lyrics on this album? Keenan: Like I always do: piece by piece, word by word. Puzzles. Depending on the tempos and moods, key lines will come to me while driving with the music in the player.What do you mean by puzzles? Keenan: Everything is a puzzle. You've got to put the pieces together and they all form a map or story. You have to be cohesive and you have to make a literary map â€“ start putting those Latin pieces together to form a map and it all makes sense.What does the title, Eat the Elephant, mean to you? Howerdel: You'd have to ask Maynard. Keenan: Yeah, I'm not going to go there.No? Keenan: I never explain any of that stuff.It struck me as political commentary. Keenan: It could be a lot of things. It's not one thing. None of them are one thing.You made a press bio that contains the line, ""With a title like Eat the Elephant, A Perfect Circleâ€™s new record has clear political overtones that Keenan admits could stir up controversy."" Keenan: You're going to go straight there, huh? Well Dan Dunn, the guy who wrote American Wino, wrote that. I told him, ""Bios are generally boring. I have an idea where Billy was cryogenically frozen and woken up today. Would you write that?"" It sums up what it would like to be frozen in 2004 and wake up in 2018 and go, ""What the fuck?"" So he went with it, and I think he did a great job [laughs]. ...You don't want to be too topical, because then you date your art. But there's definitely a lot of iconic things that go on nowadays that are wroth mentioning that I feel like we just take as rote, we just accept it like it's standard. Imagine being cryogenically frozen for 14 years and waking up and going, ""What are you people doing to your faces? Why are you doing that? You all look like Whoville. You're not fooling anybody â€“ you don't look better or younger. You just look different."" So I guess I just don't understand.On the subject of vanity and selfishness, there was a big hullabaloo online recently about 60 or so A Perfect Circle fans being kicked out of one of your concerts for taking photos Â_â€“ Keenan: [Interrupts tersely] They're not being ejected from our shows for taking photos. They're being ejected because they're recording things and they're annoying the fuck out of their neighbors.Going back to the subject of waking up 14 years later, imagine being cryogenically frozen and finding out that Donald Trump was president. Keenan: I mean you could wake up and it's Corey Feldman. Like, ""What the fuck are you talking about right now? Ted Nugent's running for senator? Come on. You're kidding, right?""Luckily, Kid Rock was joking. Keenan: Yeah, no kidding [laughs].On ""Hourglass"" you sing about plutocrats and ""Republicrats"" in a robotic, sort of Kraftwerk tone. How did you come up with that approach? Keenan: It's just sonics. You listen to what's happening and you start to adjust fire according to where you're hitting.  Howerdel: The original version of the song was much more subdued, much more like a lullaby in the chorus in the beginning. But Maynard responded to it and the vocals were much more bombastic and stylized. So the music had to meet him. That song was definitely one of the ones I had in my folder of music for Ashes Divide or a Billy Howerdel project because it was much more dance. It definitely has a heavier disco driving beat, which just became more angular in his final version and German in spirit. It was much more Depeche Mode in essence and got more angular.Another interesting vocal thing is the first line of ""By and Down the River."" You sing it with a little, maybe Indian inflection. Can you tell me about that? Keenan: That's something I've done for a while. I'm not sure where I picked that up. Probably on the road listening to various world music â€“ a lot of people that Peter Gabriel brought to the Passion soundtrack for The Last Temptation of Christ. I was listening to a lot of that stuff before the film came out, so it was really nice to hear him put all these people together on one film soundtrack. That could be the influence.Also regarding influences, ""So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"" references the deaths of Muhammad Ali, Carrie Fisher and David Bowie. Have you been really affected by these deaths? Keenan: I think it was a big curveball for a lot of people to have that concentration of celebrities, people that are iconic, exit. I'm sure it's happened in prior generations â€“ all of a sudden, an exodus â€“ but the immediacy of social media made it more impactful with more of a rapid fire to be able to see that list every day of people that you were familiar with over the years passing. And at the age of 53, you start to take it pretty seriously.Did you take any of these deaths particularly hard, personally? Keenan: Not necessarily hard. I mean, that's life. It is temporary. It's always been something that I've embraced. But you only have so much time, do stuff with it. When all those people are leaving, I guess it's a good opportunity to remind people of that: Pay attention.You played a few of these new songs live recently. Did any of them change from doing them live? Howerdel: A little bit of ""Feathers"" and ""Hourglass"" got tweaked a little bit. We tried some things live where we'd extend a section here or there and it went back. I think things changed vocally probably more than anything, but when it came to recording the finals, I played live what I consider the important lead elements of the song. I think ""Hourglass"" worked live, but I think what we did on the record worked for the record. I don't know that we won't go back to the way it was live before. And with ""The Doomed,"" nothing's really changed. We just got live and made the best presentation of it and I think it sounds good.Was it easier for you, Billy, working with Dave? Howerdel: It was easier in the sense that I didn't have to be responsible for the [music] files. In the past I just worried too much about, ""How am I going to get my gear down to the studio or do this or that?"" And then I was able to say, ""OK, I hired someone to help me do stuff."" [Laughs] I had someone come with me who could help me. He would do whatever I needed him to do, whether it was editing or setting up my rig or getting the computer synced up with Dave's. So it was a very different experience.What did Dave add to the songs? Howerdel: The title track, ""Eat the Elephant,"" was a song that was really important to me. Two people I know had committed suicide in the course of a week and there was a lot of emotion that went into finishing that. Dave took that song, which was just a demo, and took my vocal off and simplified it and gave it to Maynard, who loved it. He took it and ran with it. Then Maynard wrote and sang all the lyrics and vocals.Was it any different when you brought it to the band â€“ James Iha, Matt McJunkins and Jeff Friedl? Howerdel: Honestly, Maynard and I worked on this record for the most part. Matt played bass on a couple songs and Jeff played some drums. At the end of the day, because I wasn't recording, I'm not sure exactly which drummer it was that made it onto each track, but there were multiple drummers for the record.Maynard, you used to say that you felt like A Perfect Circle and Tool were too beholden to record labels and album-release cycles. It seems to me you've been able to reclaim a lot of your schedule because of the way the industry has changed in the last 10 years. Keenan: Yeah. I think so. But I think the beauty of labels and deadlines is that artists, free spirits and creative thinkers hide behind them, but it's actually just because they're lazy and don't want to be told what to do. A deadline is helpful. And if you miss it, you miss it, but you have to hold yourself to it as best you can.Speaking of which, Danny Carey has been saying Tool would be releasing a new album this year. Can you say anything about that, Maynard? Keenan: [Pauses] No.It's just something a lot of people are curious about. Keenan: [Longer pause] Yeah, I've got nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,Elias Leight,2018-02-01T20:22:00.000Z,Drawing 'Blood': How Former It Band Rhye Returned From the Brink,"Rhye Blood album, Mike Milosh, New Rhye album, Rhye, Rhye Blood, Rhye Mike Milosh, ",Rolling Stone,"In the fall of 2012, Mike Milosh released ""Open,"" his first single under the name Rhye, a track that melded hushed chamber pop with a serene electronic pulse. The music was unwaveringly gentle, but surprisingly, it incited a major-label feeding frenzy. ""I was not expecting 20 labels to be fighting for it,"" Milosh remembers, speaking in his hotel room in downtown Manhattan on a frigid January day. ""As a joke, this sounds super cocky, but I was like, 'I'll sign with a major label if they give me a million bucks.' And then it was super weird: Polydor basically gave me a million dollars."" This payday turned out to be less of a life-changer than it sounds, partly because most of it was lost to taxes, but also because Milosh doesn't measure his success via the usual metrics. ""When I'm working on stuff, I only think it's good if I can get reactions out of people,"" he explains. ""I love watching people listening to the music with headphones â€“ when they hold their breath, when they close their eyes. If people get a little quivery lip, that's good. I'm not thinking, 'This will make a million dollars!'""For Milosh, these sorts of reactions may also be longer-lasting than a six-figure deal: His relationship with Polydor quickly unravelled. He didn't satisfy the label's first-week sales expectations, went into debt on the first leg of the initial Rhye tour and ended up in a year-long process of buying out his contract so he could exist without Polydor looking over his shoulder. In addition, Robin Hannibal, the ace producer who was initially billed as Milosh's partner in Rhye, left the group. Following all this drama, there are higher stakes surrounding the second Rhye album, Blood, out Friday. ""I have a big investment in this project being good,"" Milosh says. This tense backstory contrasts with the casual origins of Rhye â€“ and the pillowy ease of their music. Milosh, a music-school graduate with a jazz drumming background and an electroacoustic studies major, put out three electronic albums through the Los Angeles indie Plug Research during the 2000s. He lived the life of an itinerant musician, with stints in Thailand, Holland and Montreal. While temporarily settled in Berlin, he was asked to do a remix for his Plug Research label mates Quadron, a Danish soul duo containing Hannibal and the singer Coco O. What started as a remix project turned into the first three Rhye songs (""Major Minor Love,"" ""The Fall,"" ""Woman"") and eventually set off a bidding war. These songs were velvety and wistful. Over featherweight funk grooves, Milosh sang long, fragile vocal lines, joined frequently by strings and woodwind instruments. Jason Bentley, music director for L.A.'s KCRW, was an early supporter of Rhye. ""The music catches that infinite free-fall of really feeling love and passion for someone â€“ when you first come across that, and it's such a precious thing,"" he says.Rhye also boosted interest early on by purposefully cultivating anonymity â€“ during a live session for KCRW, Bentley remembers Milosh singing swathed in darkness. ""I appreciate artists that are trying to create a mythology,"" Bentley adds. ""I don't think it happens enough or is done well enough. I love that shit. This is style; this is artistic vision.""But Rhye's anonymity soon fell away, and the idea that the group was a partnership vanished soon after â€“ around the time that labels started offering the big bucks. Milosh now describe's Hannibal's role in the first album as just, ""a hired guy that helped me."" Milosh's name was the only one on the Polydor contract.&nbsp;In response, Hannibal â€“ who has gone on to produce important recordings for Yuna and DVSN, pushing his sound further into R&amp;B's mainstream â€“ offered his first public statement about his exit from Rhye. ""Mike and I formed Rhye together,"" he said. ""We came up with the concept, the name, and the visuals and co-wrote all the music for our debut album, Woman, together in the spare bedroom of my Los Feliz apartment. At the time I had just been signed to Epic Records as a member of the duo Quadron and so was not legally able to sign to another major label, instead signing on as our project's producer with an equal share. I'm very proud of Woman&nbsp;â€“ it will always hold a special place in my heart. I wasn't involved in the making of the second album, but I wish Mike the best of luck.""""I don't want people only crying. You want some dynamics in there."" â€“Mike MiloshAfter parting ways with Hannibal, Milosh played 476 shows to raise enough money to both buy out his Polydor deal and fund the next iteration of Rhye. ""[Label troubles] motivated me to become a monster tourer,"" he says. Gig money in hand, Milosh set about making a second Rhye record with a new set of behind-the-scenes players. Blood includes contributions from Nate Mercereau, former guitarist for Sheila E who is also credited on Jay-Z's 4:44 (for six different instruments); Justin Parker, who has written hits for Lana Del Rey and Rihanna; King Henry, who co-produced BeyoncÃ©'s ""All Night"" and Major Lazer's ""Cold Water;"" and Thomas Bartlett, who has put out well-received albums as Doveman and produced Sufjan Stevens' Carrie &amp; Lowell.Despite personnel changes, many of the ingredients from the first Rhye album reappear on Blood. ""I kind of sing in a way that's more Gregorian; I often feel my music is more classical than it's soul,"" Milosh says. ""But I happen to love rhythm, so it has that sensibility."" A few of the new songs, like second single ""Count to Five,"" which has been getting played on some Adult Alternative Album radio stations, are the liveliest to date in the Rhye catalog, verging on danceable. ""I don't want people only crying,"" Milosh says. ""You want some dynamics in there.""But tears are OK, too. ""When I first recorded ['Stay Safe'], I played it for a friend while driving in Atlanta,"" the singer remembers. ""She started having this really beautiful reaction: She started crying. That's a huge reward when you see you can affect someone like that.""Now that Rhye is out of limbo, Milosh is eager to make up for lost time. ""I don't want to wait five years for another album,"" he says. ""I already started the next Rhye record. Why would I stop?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,Elias Leight,2017-12-15T05:01:00.000Z,Eminem's 'Revival': A Track-by-Track Guide,"eminem, eminem revival, eminem revival track by track, eminem revival review, eminem revival rolling stone, eminem revival tracklist, eminem best songs, eminem discography, eminem revival best songs, haillie mathers",Rolling Stone,"Eminem, the best-selling rapper of all time, returned at midnight with Revival, his first album in four years. The new LP sprawls across 19 tracks, touching on rock, gospel, pop and, of course, hard-bitten hip-hop. Eminem veers from sassy to self-deprecating, dependent to dismissive, murderous to politically conscious, uncontrollably lusty to borderline repentant, sometimes all within the same song. He raps over skeletal, golden-age beats courtesy of Rick Rubin and stirring piano ballads from longtime collaborator Alex da Kid; he teams up with locally known artists like Phresher as well as global stars like BeyoncÃ©, Pink and Alicia Keys. Across it all, Eminem remains intent on convincing listeners that he's still at the top of his game: ""Will I ever fall off/That day'll never come."" Here's a guide to understanding the album's producers, songwriters, guests and key themes.1. ""Walk On Water"" feat. BeyoncÃ©Back in 2000, Eminem opened The Marshall Mathers LP with a sarcastic public service announcement: ""Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think!"" It got nastier (and funnier) from there. But that was the old Marshall, and it turns out the new Marshall really does give a fuck what you think. Revival starts in a way that would have been unimaginable in the old days, with solemn piano chords, an honest-to-god gospel chorus from BeyoncÃ©, and Eminem earnestly asking, ""Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?""There's no punchline. This is a serious, vulnerable track about the doubts that nag at a rap god late at night. He's heard your criticisms of his latter-day work, and they hit home. In the second verse, he makes the stakes he's chosen for Revival explicit, referencing the critical and commercial high-water mark of the original MMLP (""It's the curse of the standard/That the first of the Mathers discs set"") and describing his writing process in relatable terms: ""It always feels like I'm hitting the mark /Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart/Like, this shit is garbage!""BeyoncÃ© comes through with humility and grace, and storied producer Rick Rubin (along with co-producer Skylar Grey) provides a sound that's closer to the albums he made with Johnny Cash than the tougher-than-leather Run-DMC/Beasties beat he served up for ""Berzerk"" on Em's last album. Mathers plays along, bringing a thoughtful tone and flow to match. Then he snaps out of it in the track's final seconds: ""Me and you are not alike/Bitch, I wrote 'Stan'!"" 2. ""Believe""Trappish snares and a minimal piano line give Revival's second track a more contemporary feel â€“ this is the sound of a rapper in his mid-40s doing his best to keep up with the kids. He's pretty comfortable in this new setting, even sneaking a not-groanworthy use of the word ""lit"" into his first verse. A bit later, he gets off some great internal-rhyme runs in a thuggish-ruggish Midwestern cadence: ""But I still remember the days of/Minimum wage for/General labor/Welfare recipient as a minor/Look how government assistance has made you!"" That verse builds up to one of his more memorable recent solo choruses, with shades of ""The Way I Am"" and ""Cleaning Out My Closet."" The lingering questions that he emphasized on ""Walk on Water"" are still in the picture here (""Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chaseâ€_.But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pangs once you've won the race?""). But he's off and running now.3. ""Chloraseptic"" feat. PhresherFans flipped out when they saw that the only guest MC featured on Revival's tracklist was Brooklyn's own Phresher, best known for his street hit ""Wait a Minute,"" which blew up about a year ago and subsequently got remixed by everyone from Remy Ma to Riff Raff to 50 Cent to Royce da 5'9"". The latter connection likely explains how Eminem ended up calling in a hook from the NYC up-and-comer. ""The record is about just spitting, man...Just cutthroat, at your throat music,"" Phresher told Complex, adding, ""It's raw as fuck.""True enough, Eminem gives a revved-up performance, dubbing himself the ""Simon Cowell of rhyming foul,"" memorably declaring ""I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee"" and providing a detailed description of how he plans to murder you using the wire from a notebook full of your weak-ass rhymes. The rumbling beat from his old friend Denaun Porter (a.k.a. Kon Artis from D-12) brings out his energetic, mischievous side.4. ""Untouchable""If any alt-right Eminem fans out there were hoping to forget about his Trump dis at the BET Hip Hop Awards, here he comes with even more vitriol. This six-minute song is Em's most ambitious political statement ever, expanding and deepening the critique of American racism that he started outlining 15 years ago on ""White America."" He spends the first half of ""Untouchable"" rapping from the perspective of a racist white cop, laying out exactly how he profiles and terrorizes black communities. The guitar-sampling beat from longtime cohorts Mr. Porter, Emile and Mark Batson makes this part of the song feel something like verse two of Jay-Z's ""99 Problems"" with the viewpoint shifted to the state trooper's side.Then the beat switches to a moody piano loop, and Eminem raps from the perspective of a black American man in 2017. He gets fired up denouncing police brutality, segregation, hiring discrimination, flag-waving hypocrisy and other forms of systemic racism: ""Fuck your Republican views/Pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?"" It's a lot to take in, and early reactions to ""Untouchable"" from within the rap world have been divided. 5. ""River"" feat. Ed SheeranAccording to Ed Sheeran, much of ""River"" was recorded in March 2016 while he vacationed at actor Russell Crowe's farm in Australia. ""I used the studio at Russell's house,"" Sheeran told Billboard. ""Played the drums on it, and then played the guitar, and then recorded the thing and wrote the chorus and did the piano on it, and then sent it off and then didn't hear anything back."" Produced by Emile Haynie, the final version of ""River"" opens with Sheeran's lament about being ""a liar and a cheat,"" then flows into Eminem's lyrics about one-night stands, and the guilt and recriminations that follow. ""Now that I got you I don't want you/Took advantage and my thirst to pursue/Why do I do this dirt that I do?"" he asks.6. ""Remind Me"" (Intro)7. ""Remind Me""The cheeky hard rock of ""Remind Me"" is reminiscent of his 2013 single ""Berzerk"": Both rely heavily on a sample of Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts' ""I Love Rock &amp; Roll."" And just like that Billboard top 3 hit, he uses ""Remind Me"" to unleash his horndog id, crowing about a big-booty woman with silicone breasts as big as the late Anna Nicole Smith's. ""Excuse me ma, I'm just too raw,"" he raps. Still, he avoids referring to his conquest in derogatory terms, and the track seems more fun-loving than an expression of Slim Shady's misogynist impulses. In a conversation with Elton John for Interview magazine, he talked about his relationship with the track's producer, Rick Rubin. ""[Rubin and I] were talking about a song or something, and he said, â€˜I don't really consider myself smart enough to know what everybody's going to think, so I just do what feels right for me,'"" Eminem remembered.8. Revival (Interlude)9. ""Like Home"" feat. Alicia KeysWith a soaring chorus from Alicia Keys and production from Alex da Kid, ""Like Home"" continues the anti-Trump war that Eminem kicked off on last year's single ""Campaign Speech,"" and reignited during the BET Hip-Hop Awards. ""This chump barely even sleeps/All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats/While he looks like a canary with a beak/Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?"" he raps. (Critics of Eminem's past lyrics about LGBTQ people may be surprised at his implicit support for transgender soldiers.)&nbsp;Eminem also takes some blame for Trump's past appearance in ""Shady Convention,"" a mock political video ad that promoted his then-new Shade45 satellite channel. ""Take it back to the Shady national convention/Wish I had spit on it before I went to shake his hand at the event/Or maybe had the wherewithal/To know that he was going to try to tear apart/Our sacred land we cherish and stand for."" When he spoke to Elton John for Interview, he elaborated on his antipathy towards Trump. ""As long as he's got his base, he does not give a fuck about anybody else in America. But guess what? There's more of us than there are of them. I still feel like America is the greatest country to live in. This is my opinion. But we have issues that we need to work on and we need to do better.""10. ""Bad Husband"" feat. X AmbassadorsEminem has often picked at the volatility of male-female relationships in uncomfortably scabrous terms, most memorably on his 2010 hit ""Love the Way You Lie."" But the Alex da Kid-produced ""Bad Husband"" has a disturbing ring of truth, if only because it mentions Hailie Jade Mathers, Eminem's daughter with his ex-wife Kim Scott. ""We carry on with our public spats,"" he raps, perhaps referencing to the avalanche of tabloid press that chronicled Eminem and Scott's tumultuous relationship in the late Nineties and early Aughts. ""You hit me once, and that I would use/To continue the pattern of abuse/Why did I punch back?/Girl, your dad is a scumbag,"" he raps as he alternates between addressing Hailie and Kim. Then he continues a pattern of repentance for using his family as artistic fodder that started with 2013's ""Headlights,"" his memorable apology to his mother. ""But I'm sorry Kim/More than you can ever comprehend/Leaving you was fucking harder than/Sawing off a fucking body limb."" A chorus and backing arrangement from X Ambassadors, the ""Renegades"" rock band that first worked with Em on ""Wicked Ways,"" conjures a melancholy sound of redemption.11. ""Tragic Endings"" feat. Skylar GreyEminem remains in his comfort zone â€“ exploring a vicious codependent romance â€“ on the arena-rap ballad ""Tragic Endings."" ""There's just something 'bout her/ That makes me not able to function without her,"" Eminem admits. But don't think this is happily-ever-after: ""The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself,"" he raps. ""To see me falling to pieces brings her joy.""The claustrophobic hook of ""Tragic Endings"" is provided by Grey, a frequent Eminem collaborator. She helped write the rapper's Number One smash ""Love the Way You Lie"" along with ""Tragic Endings"" producer Alex da Kid; she also penned Revival blockbuster BeyoncÃ© collaboration ""Walk on Water."" She works in lockstep with Eminem on ""Tragic Endings"" to drive home the suffocating nature of this relationship. ""I'm dying to breathe and all you do is strangle me,"" she sings. ""What a relief.""12. ""Framed""For ""Framed,"" Eminem reaches back to early tracks like ""'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde"" in both sound â€“ relying on the simplest of beats, just two guitar licks and an unchanging drum loop â€“ and violent content: The rapper offers advice here on how to get away with homicide. ""When murdering females better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed,"" he warns. ""Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail.""Back in ""'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde,"" Eminem was driving through the night with his longtime antagonist â€“ and ex-wife â€“ Kim dead in the back, but this time he envisions tangling with Eighties supermodel Christie Brinkley and the President's daughter: ""Dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?"" ""Framed"" wraps up with a half-hearted declaration of innocence. ""There's a missing person, so what? He's got nothing to do with me/ I'm almost certain I was framed.""13. ""Nowhere Fast"" feat. KehlaniEminem faces off with a frantic string section, agitated hi-hats and the apocalypse on ""Nowhere Fast,"" defying terrorist attacks at one moment and his rap competition the next: ""For MCs it's a funeral when I'm devising this rhyme/ Cause I'm awake and you're mourning, that's why I rise and I shine."" Eminem may be 45 years old, but he has little interest in reflecting on his own mortality. ""To the pine box: Bitch, fuck you,"" he raps. ""I'm better than I ever was.""Kehlani joins Eminem to provide the atmospheric melodic accompaniment that he appears to favor everywhere on Revival. She sings sentimental lines about living fast and dying young: ""Never looking back and we're never getting old/ 'Cause the skies are black but our hearts made of gold."" ""Honored to be on this album, and in such amazing company,"" she wrote on Instagram when Eminem shared the Revival track list earlier this month. ""I can't wait for the world to hear this.""14. ""Heat""After slamming President Trump throughout Revival, Eminem finds surprising common ground with him in ""Heat,"" one of the album's lustiest songs. ""Grab you by the [meow sound effect], hope it's not a problem, in fact,"" he raps. ""About the only fact I agree on with Donald is that."" Eminem is single-mindedly priapic here, so even when he takes a moment to shout out this track's producer, Rick Rubin, he twists the tribute into a pick-up line: ""Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat.""Rubin provides the sort of skeletal rap-rock accompaniment he served Eminem four years ago on The Marshall Mathers LP 2 track ""Berserk"" â€“ distorted guitar and scratching vinyl sputter high in the mix. The primary riff is pulled from the Boogie Nights soundtrack's ""Intro (Feel the Heat),"" a song performed in the film by John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg. ""Heat"" also ends with a brief snippet of Boogie Nights dialog from Wahlberg's character that fits easily next to Eminem's verses: ""It's my big dick, so everybody get ready right fucking now.""15. ""Offended""""Offended"" features Revival's most technically impressive passage, a blistering display of speed near the end of the songâ€“ countless syllables crammed into 12 or 13 seconds â€“ that aims for the record books. The rest of the track rises from the same fertile ground as ""Just Don't Give a Fuck"" and ""Bad Influence,"" old songs in which Eminem turns listeners' hatred of him into a badge of honor â€“ or maybe a suit of armor.As always, antipathy spurs him to cross even more lines and break even more taboos; here he describes himself with allusions to men accused of sexual assault (Bill Cosby, R. Kelly) and child murder (Justin Ross Harris). And yet again, Eminem guns for Trump, still annoyed that the President did not reply to his BET freestyle. He also goes after Ivanka and Melania. ""Shit's on, bruh,"" Eminem declares. ""... Ivanka, stiff arm her/While I'm hittin' on Melania/And this song's for all ya.""The MC alternates between hard, low rapping and nursery-rhyme sing-song on ""Offended,"" borrowing his hook from a bleak source â€“ ""The Knife Game Song."" The taut, jumpy, brassy ""Offended"" instrumental was crafted by Illa da Producer, who also helmed Lil Pump's ""Pinky Ring"" and French Montana's ""Have Mercy."" Eminem takes a moment to compliment the beat-maker's work, noting that, ""These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me."" ""I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it,"" he adds a few lines later. ""Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it.""16. ""Need Me"" feat. Pink""Need Me"" is Eminem's second collaboration with Pink. But in contrast to the playful ""Revenge,"" off of her October album Beautiful Trauma, ""Need Me"" is a bombastic power ballad dominated by Alex da Kid's cavernous percussion. Pink sings two verses and choruses before Eminem comes in for the song's one lengthy, intense rap verse. But something happens in the first half of ""Need Me"" that's rarely been heard in Eminem's many collaborations with female singers: he harmonizes with Pink, his voice gradually appearing during her second verse. Darting in and out of the track's lurching waltz rhythm, Marshall vents about a dysfunctional relationship: ""Starting to think we were made for each other/ But one of us in this relationship is raising the other/ You remind me of my mother.""17. ""In Your Head""""In Your Head"" opens with Dolores O'Riordan's voice beamed in from 1994 as a sample of the Cranberries hit ""Zombie,"" and runs underneath the entirety of the track. The song is produced by Scram Jones, a New York-based MC/producer who's been chopping samples for Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah, and others since the early 2000s, but has never worked with Eminem before.Em spends most of ""In Your Head"" castigating himself over career missteps: ""Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing but back to where I was/ And perhaps this could've been my victory lap if I wasn't on the verge of Relapse.""18. ""Castle"" feat. Skylar Grey""I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne,"" Skylar Grey sings at the opening of ""Castle."" Each verse of the song is a letter, complete with pencil and paper sound effects echoing ""Stan."" But this time, the letters are from Marshall Mathers to his daughter Hailie; the first letter is a few weeks before her 1995 birth, the second is a year later, and the third is on her 12th birthday. The third verse ends with Eminem at a low point in 2007, overdosing on methadone and nearly dying. ""Your dad's at the end of his rope/I'm sliding down a slippery slope/Anyway, sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepyâ€_Love, Dad, shit, I don't know.""19. ""Arose""""Arose"" opens with a loop of ""The Rose,"" the title song from Bette Midler's 1979 album and film of the same name. Picking up where the narrative of ""Castle,"" ended, Eminem is recounting his 2007 overdose, speaking to his family and to his longtime D12 groupmate Proof, whose 2006 death ""tore me in two."" Four minutes into ""Arose,"" Eminem declares ""To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape"" and the song abruptly stops, and the third verse of ""Castle"" begins again. But this time it ends differently, ""I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet."" The album concludes with a new day dawning, and the sound of a toilet flushing.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,Brian Hiatt,2018-02-22T20:44:23.230Z,"The Last Word: George Clinton on Alien Encounters, Trump's Lack of Funk","george clinton, parliament-funkadelic",Rolling Stone,"Parliament-Funkadelic founder George Clinton is an irreplaceable walking museum of American musical history, with a career that began in Fifties doo-wop (the Parliaments were originally a Newark, N.J., singing group), and continues all the way to Kendrick-era hip-hop and beyond. Clinton put out an excellent, memorably titled memoir, Brothas Be, Yo Like George, Ain't That Funkin' Kinda Hard on You?, in 2014, and he suggests he's already done enough additional living for another book â€“ though he's more focused on an upcoming documentary and a new album. He called in for a characteristically amusing and enlightening Last Word interview while on the road for his latest tour, which is set to run through April.Who are the funkiest people who ever lived?When I'm just tryna funk, it's gonna be the Staple Singers, man â€“ Pop Staples. And Ray Charles. Ray could take ""Eleanor Rigby"" and make that funky. He ends up doing that to anything â€“ to me, that's raw funk. And then [Motown session bassist] James Jamerson â€“ that is a musician.And who is the least funky person alive?Oh, my God! [Laughs] Probably Trump. Can't be no funk in the Trump! [Pauses] He ain't gonna like that.Where did the idea of ""free your mind and your ass will follow"" come from? And do you stand by the advice?I think I was just saying it as a stream of consciousness, you know? But as I get older, I see it as the same thing as ""Let go and use the Force, Luke."" If your head ain't right, everything you try to fix is going to be messed up, 'cause your brain is what you need to fix it.Same idea as ""Maggot Brain,"" really.Yeah, same thing! Same thing. If you got maggots in your brain, everything you think is gonna be rotten.What advice would you give your younger self?Stop looking for anything else to be LSD. If you knew that it was never gonna be like that first hit, you could've stopped a long time ago.So you never regretted LSD?As soon as Woodstock happened, LSD was over. It became commercial, $5 a tab. Then that mind-manipulation thing it did became dangerous because anybody could program your ass when you're on it.How do you feel about white artists doing black music?I'd bite off the Beatles, or anybody else. It's all one world, one planet and one groove. You're supposed to learn from each other, blend from each other, and it moves around like that. You see that rocket ship leave yesterday? We can maybe leave this planet. We gonna be dealing with aliens. You think black and white gonna be a problem? Wait till you start running into motherfuckers with three or four dicks! Bug-eyed motherfuckers! They could be ready to party, or they could be ready to eat us. We don't know, but we've got to get over this shit of not getting along with each other.You and Bootsy Collins had an alien encounter, right?Yeah, and we wasn't high. A light hit the car, and a substance like mercury out of the thermometer rolled up the side of the car.Liquid metal that moved, like in Terminator 2?That's exactly what it looked like.""You just have to figure your way how to dance your way out of your constriction.""How have you been able to find such consistently great musicians over the years?They usually be out of the box, but still appealing. Somebody you can't control, or won't do it normal. I learned that anything that get on your nerves â€“ the parents don't like, the old musicians don't like, and kids seem to be liking it â€“ that's usually the shit. But you then have to learn how to balance it. It can't go&nbsp;all up into the crazy, 'cause that's what you're flirting with.Parliament came from your doo-wop quartet, the Parliaments. You've said when doo-wop was dying, you were sad but excited to see what was next, right?Even though I loved the Fifties doo-wop, you couldn't hold on to it. You had to change, or you was gon' be antique real quick, like the Ink Spots. And then we were at Motown and you had the Rolling Stones, simple rock &amp; roll became the new thing. So we turned the volume up and got slick, almost jazzy musicians â€“ Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, Bootsy playing simple, but making it smooth and brand-new â€“ with the concept of clones or whatever we was talking about.Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of this country?I'm optimistic about it, because whatever happened, that's the way it's supposed to be. If He did it, He did it all. You just have to figure your way how to dance your way out of your constriction. And pray, have faith and all that shit.Would you be cool with a hologram of yourself going on tour after you're no longer with us?I already made a hologram. I did it with the whole band. Maybe they can have it start performing in Vegas or some shit. I wanted to give something to my family.What do you want people to say about you when you're gone?He made me sick, but he gave me the antidote.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,Andy Greene,2017-11-02T18:51:00.000Z,"Art Garfunkel on His Unusual New Book, the End of Simon and Garfunkel","Art Garfunkel, Art Garfunkel book, Simon and Garfunkel",Rolling Stone,"In the spring of 1983, Art Garfunkel stepped out of his New York apartment building and began a walk across North America. The journey was conducted across 40 installments (always picking up exactly where the last one ended) and took him 14 years to complete. The whole time, he had a small notepad and pen in his back pocket. ""I'd stay at two-star inns during the night,"" he says. ""And when inspiration struck me, I'd write little bits. There must have been a thousand of them."" Those bits included poems, lists, scattered thoughts and pointed anecdotes from his long career. He never gave much thought to publishing them until he showed them to literary agent Dan Strone a few years back. ""He said, 'You have a book here,'"" recalls Garfunkel. ""I then shaped them chronologically and said, 'It's my life.'""The end result is What Is It All But Luminous: Notes From an Underground Man, which is unlike any book ever released by a rock star. There are segments about the formation and ultimate bitter dissolution of Simon and Garfunkel, along with other passages about his long life, but they are mixed in with lists of books he's read and songs on his iPod, quotes from the likes of Shakespeare and Marvin Gaye, and set lists from his concerts. There are also numerous poems, including one about getting a colonic by a woman from Queens. (""After the evacuation behind the bathroom door, I mention the clickety sound of colonics, so she tap dances on the hardwood floor."")Right now, Garfunkel is perched on a chaise lounge on the roof of a luxury New York apartment building overlooking a picturesque, panoramic view of the skyline. He just returned from a U.S. book tour and he's resting up before flying off to Japan for a series of solo dates. A grey, floppy hat rests on his head, a packet of Lifesavers peeks out of his front pocket, and in his hand is his book. Over the next hour, he happily fielded any question Rolling Stone threw his way, though, unsurprisingly, he didn't feel like sharing why he's no longer on speaking terms with Paul Simon. I read about the fire at your apartment a couple years back. Are you living here now?For now. [The smoke damage] led to a major fixing up of our place. My wife took over and I stepped back, so I've been living here. It's been two years, but very shortly I get to move back in.How bad was the damage?Not so bad. We have three floors. The top floor is a library. I like to be up there to make my phone calls and do my writing. I love my books. I have 1,165 of them spread around the walls. Every one I read. In order. They're good books. It's Darwin, Origin of the Species, the good stuff. They are all there. Well, I lost one of the walls in the fire. There went a hundred of them. So I replaced them. Every damn one of them.I've always been fascinated by your perfect handwriting. Did you write the whole book out by hand?Yeah. When I was 11, Paul Simon, my fast friend, would say to people, ""Look at my friend Artie, he's the human typewriter."" It was sweet. But I hate to disappoint you, though I did write the whole book top to bottom with my left hand. And then Vicky Wilson, my great editor at Knopf, said to me, ""Here's what I want you to do. Give me your perfect A, B, C, D ... and we will digitize that and we will have the ability to manipulate [and turn it into a font for the book.]""Did you read books by other musicians while preparing for this one?Well, there's the famous Keith Richards book and the Clapton one. These books are giant sellers. I did not read either of them. I don't put myself into the category of ""rock star writing his biography."" That's because we live our lives by falling into experiences. Things happen to us. Something you do takes hold of you and then you do a lot of it. And it has a name. And then it wraps itself around you and then an interviewer asks you, ""When did you start this endeavor?""Did you ever think about writing a traditional memoir without the poetry and lists and everything?Well, you're starting from the starting point as if a person begins with a desk and a clean piece of paper. But your premise is wrong. We don't start with any beginning. We never know what we're doing. We fall into it. I fell into these scraps of paper and I was told, ""You may have a book here."" I started shaping it up. Dan Strone shopped it around. I fell into the experience. I knew it was different from other things. I'm always different. I'm an eccentric man.There's a bunch of books about Simon and Garfunkel. Have you read any of them?I read one many years ago. What can I say? It didn't capture ... I think the main thing about us is that we're good. We're very good. We take two very different people, Artie and Paul, who have very different natures and found a fusion. It's a cute trick.You wrote in the book that your friendship with Paul was ""shattered"" in 1958 when he made a solo deal behind your back.[Puts up his hands like a boxer] Now, watch out for Andy. He's going to come in on you now. It's what Muhammad Ali did.""Shattered"" is a pretty strong statement. You guys were just kids when that happened.So you read my book properly. It's a strong statement. Ask me your precise question, Mr. Greene.I was just taken aback that you felt things were shattered that early. Did everything feel differently after that?Yes.Hmmm ...Notice that I'm not helping you much.That's OK.But yes, it's a very strong statement. You were wise to pick up on it and go, ""Well, that upsets the whole Simon and Garfunkel thing."" I'm not going to fight that.So how did you maintain your friendship with him during the Simon and Garfunkel days in the Sixties if you felt he shattered it before it even started?You mean I should be a perfectionist and hope that friendships have no blemishes? Isn't that compulsively ... isn't that too perfectionist? Everything has blemishes. I'm fooling around now with the answer. I'm saying, ""Well, of course there's stains. There's stains in everything."" We try and accept them and carry on. It's a mixed bag. You're talking about a man who's a tremendous talent. It's a real turn-on to sit in the same room and make music with a tremendous talent.I spoke to him about a year and a half ago. He told me you guys were no longer on speaking terms.[Stares into my eyes and doesn't respond]May I ask what happened?I don't think you can because there are things that are personal and deep between us, instead of the Internet, your readers. ...That's fair.Good. I'm glad you see that.In 2015 you called him a ""jerk"" and said that you ""created a monster"" by becoming his friend in the first place. Do you regret saying all that?Yes. I do. [Smiling] You press people, you get stuff out of us. You're going to come with one any minute. You're going to find me relaxing and you're going to come with the left hook.Are you hopeful you two will patch things up and maybe sing together again one day?Not particularly.Why?Now, the word ""enough"" just flew into my mind. ...OK. I'll move on. I know I was pushing my luck there. How is your solo tour going now? I know that you've been back on the road now for a few years.I love my show. I lost my voice in 2010. That's seven years ago. Tragic. I had come off an arena tour with Pauly â€“ [whispers] he goes, ""Pauly? That sounds pretty friendly with me. They're not that angry with each other. ..."" â€“ in the Far East. When I got home a month later my voice went south. I couldn't speak. I couldn't sing. It was all froggy. When I saw the doctor, he said, ""Yeah, the camera shows one of your two vocal cords is fat and stiff."" That's what it felt like. But I was determined to not accept it's gone. I don't know how to be an Art Garfunkel that doesn't sing. I was dedicated to my own recovery. And it took years. I would book a hall that was empty and sing to an empty hall.It was terrible. 2012, no voice. I would fall to my knees and look up at God and say, ""Oh, man, this is tough. I don't know how to be a person."" And finally I would sing some shows where the voice crapped out. There were people in the audience. I did my best. I saw that there was lots of love and support. Here's the insider [tip]: If you pretend that you are recovered and go onstage and do your best and take the bravery of being a little crappy, but also a little there, you pull your recovery along. And by 2014 I was singing again and I was grateful to God.You have some tough songs to sing. The climax of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" would be tough for anybody.I don't do [sings] ""Like a bridge. ..."" You went right to the one part of my recovery I haven't gotten to. [Sings again] ""Like a bridge ...""That's just one little moment of one song.One. The other 99.9 percent is there, but I rewrote the end of ""Bridge."" It's beautiful. Once my voice came back, I designed a ""less is more"" show."" I called my friend Tab Laven. He's been my brother all the way through. He's been playing Paul Simon. Not easy to do. We do half Simon and Garfunkel, because it would be coy to turn my back on it. And we do songs from my 12 solo albums. In the past year, we've picked up Dave Mackay, fabulous piano player. Boy, this is an exciting thing for me. Now we have piano in a whole bunch of songs. I'm captivated by my new show. I love it so much.A lot of people lose their voice and never recover it. You must be so grateful.You bet. I finish my show with a little prayer. ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pay the Lord my soul to keep. God will save me."" When I was five I realized I had a singing voice. It was pretty. It delighted me. So it's a great gift in my throat. When you have a gift, you think about the giver. Who gave this to me? And this takes you to a spiritual sense of God. That has captivated me all through my life, serving that lucky gift.Not a lot of people that were singing professionally in 1956 are still out there doing it.I was a weird kid, a special kid.It's a shame there's no film of you guys in the Tom and Jerry days. I'd love to see you on American Bandstand.I would love to see Dick Clark ask Paul Simon where he was from. He said, ""Macon, Georgia."" I would love to see my face.It's insane you had to go on after Jerry Lee Lewis singing ""Great Balls of Fire."" It's like a scene in a movie or something.Yeah. It was great. I was a fan of American Bandstand. I would come home from school and watch those dancing kids.Then you were on it.My life spun around. It's because at age five I realized I could sing good. Then at age 11 I met this guy, Paul Simon. We fused our talents. Never forget this: Allen Freed brought this new, subversive music to New York in 1954. And we were 12, 13, a great age to be impressionable. Same as John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan. This is our age group. Rock &amp; Roll, that was Alan Freed's phrase, was born in the Western world.It's always amazed me that so many of you guys were born in this tiny window of time in the early 1940s. A few years earlier you would have been too old when rock hit. Before that, you would have been fighting in World War II. You had perfect timing.America was sitting pretty. We won World War II. We were rich. We were benevolent. We were charitable, the Marshall Plan. As God gave me a singing voice, America gave the Western world the means to get back on their feet. That's why I look at today as such a tough time.I like to think it's temporary. It's a bad chapter that will end in a few years, if not sooner.So we're not falling off a cliff together? That's the theory and its so tempting.I think we have to view it as a few big steps backwards, but progress will continue.Yes. We must think that.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,Jason Newman,2017-11-22T17:59:00.000Z,A Soul Queen Says Goodbye: Inside Sharon Jones' Final Album,"sharon jones, sharon jones posthumous album, sharon jones last album, soul of a woman, soul of a woman sharon jones, sharon jones new album",Rolling Stone,"One month after Sharon Jones died of pancreatic cancer in 2016, her closest friends and family gathered at the Universal Church of God in Queens, New York, to celebrate and mourn the exuberant, Grammy-nominated soul and funk vocalist. As a teenager, Jones had written a song titled ""Call on God"" that she would often sing with other choir members. Later in life, she'd use it to warm up in the studio and recorded the track in 2007 with backing band the Dap-Kings for their third album 100 Days, 100 Nights. But the group already had another gospel song on the album and the track was permanently shelved.Now, many of these same members who sang with Jones through the decades were in church, belting Jones' moving spiritual. ""We were all floored,"" says Neal Sugarman, Dap-Kings saxophonist and co-founder of Jones' label Daptone Records. With emotions still high following the service, the singers entered Daptone's Brooklyn studio to ""perform"" with Jones one last time on a heart-wrenching version of the song that appears on Jones' recently released final album Soul of a Woman. ""It was just an incredible moment because they were able to sing with her one last time and back her up on a song they had sung with her years and years ago,"" Daptone co-founder and Dap-Kings bassist-bandleader Gabriel Roth tells Rolling Stone. ""It was this reunion of this whole crew and you know Sharon was right there leading them on the track.""Under better circumstances, Soul of a Woman would simply be another stellar collection of songs recorded by a band that helped resurrect classic soul during the past 15 years. Instead, it doubles as Jones' musical last will and testament, recorded in between chemotherapy sessions while the singer and her acolytes faced the previously unthinkable prospect that this would be Jones' final album.The group started recording the album immediately after finishing Jones' 2014 LP&nbsp;Give the People What They Want. At this point, Jones had already been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, went into remission and saw the cancer return fiercer than before. But despite her health, Roth insists that ""there was no somber tone"" in the studio. To record Sharon Jones somber would be an implicit insult to a singer who attacked life and, to quote Roth, ""took a bite out of everything and just lit everything on fire.""&nbsp;""To my frustration and to her credit, she wouldn't come into the studio until she was really feeling it,"" he continues. ""Everybody that knows her knows she couldn't really phone it in.""""I don't think anybody approached it like, 'Here's our swan song,'"" says Roth.""As much as we knew the reality, I don't think anybody knew it could be over at any point,"" Roth adds. ""I don't think anybody approached it like, 'Here's our swan song. Here's the final dance.' There was always the optimism of going on and having more to do. Every time she was counted out, she came back fighting a lot of times. But by the time we were doing those final sessions, we obviously hoped they weren't the last, but it was definitely in our minds that it could be.""The group originally planned on a ""really moody"" album filled with strings and orchestras (or as Sugarman calls it, ""the 'Girl, you got to forgive him' stuff""). In their first session, Jones and the group laid down the slower, more balladic songs that would become Side B of the album. But realizing that Soul of a Woman may be Jones' final album, they returned to the studio to change direction and record exhilarating, uptempo tracks more in line with Jones' tireless live performances. The album's first half, including standout tracks ""Sail On!"" and ""Matter of Time,"" captures the energy of those live shows.""We would look at Sharon's situation and soon realized that what she needed was not to be singing these love song ballads,"" Sugarman says. ""What she was really good at â€_ was the real upbeat songs that she really loved and enjoyed singing a little more live.""""We all know that's what Sharon loved digging her teeth into; stuff that was a little more raw and gritty,"" Roth says. ""And as much as the band loved taking these voyages to these orchestrations and composed melodies and background vocals, that wasn't what Sharon was about live. She was carnivorous, man.""Both Roth and Sugarman are quick to contrast Soul of a Woman with posthumous compilations pairing archived vocals with new instrumentation. ""There's no outtakes on this record,"" Roth says. ""This is a new record and a recording of something that Sharon and the band put together not as a compilation or farewell."" Jones and the Dap-Kings recorded exponentially more than they released, though the status of future Jones recordings remains unclear.  ""It continues to come in and out in these weird waves of the reality that we're not going to be able to play this music with Sharon,"" says Sugarman.Still, there are projects that will forever be hypothetical. For years, Jones and Roth had talked of recording a full gospel album inspired by Aretha Franklin's landmark 1972 live gospel album Amazing Grace. ""It's very hard for me that we weren't able to get that done because I feel like that was something that was really important to her,"" Roth says. ""That record was huge for Sharon and she always wanted to do a record like that. She had been singing gospel her whole life.""Jones was the linchpin of both the Dap-Kings and Daptone Records and her death, alongside the death of fellow soul singer Charles Bradley in September, has forced the label to ponder its future. A slew of releases, including new albums by Staten Island funk group the Budos Band and British R&amp;B singer James Hunter are set for 2018, while the Dap-Kings continue to make high-profile guest appearances, most notably on Sam Smith's recently released The Thrill of It All.One year after the loss of Jones, however, the group is still struggling to regain their center. ""It's been really, really hard,"" Sugarman says. ""It continues to come in and out in these weird waves of the reality that we're not going to be able to play this music with Sharon. Everyone asks, 'What are the Dap-Kings going to do?' and nothing feels like the right move. Everyone has a suggestion, but there will never be another Sharon Jones. That's what that band was built for. What we've got to experience with Sharon, we will never get there again. I wouldn't want to be in a situation where it's not as good as it's been.""Has there been any thought on ending the band?""We've had all kinds of conversations,"" says Sugarman. But for now, Soul of a Woman is top priority. ""It's going to be a strange campaign without Sharon around and we're still trying to figure out what that means,"" admits Roth. (The group performed a heartbreaking medley of ""Sail On!"" and ""Searching for a New Day"" on The Tonight Show, showing archival footage of Jones in concert while blending live performance with her recorded vocals.)""The first time people hear [Soul of a Woman] â€“ especially the hardcore Sharon fans â€“ people are going to get real down and then it's going to take them back up,"" says Sugarman. ""From my perspective, it's one more nail in the annals of classic soul records because Sharon has proven through her catalog and live shows that she is one of the greats. Hopefully these are classic records, which means they'll live on forever.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,David Browne,2017-11-22T14:52:33.715Z,Pearl Jam's 'Vitalogy': How Band Nearly Came Apart Making Volatile Third LP,"pearl jam, pearl jam vitalogy, eddie vedder, pearl jam corduroy, pearl jam better man, vitalogy, dave abbruzzese, jack irons pearl jam, pearl jam vitalogy interview",Rolling Stone,"They wanted to call it ""Life,"" and by the time Pearl Jam began recording their third album, their lives seemed pretty charmed. Despite ignoring nearly every dictate of the music business, they had sold millions of copies of Ten and Vs. Creatively, Pearl Jam were on such fire that they began cutting their follow-up to Vs. while they were still on the road to promote it. ""It's kind of amazing when you look back,"" bassist Jeff Ament told Cameron Crowe later, ""but we really didn't have more than a couple of weeks off for the first four or five years of the band.""Yet for all their overnight success â€“ in many ways because of it â€“ Pearl Jam were on the verge of collapse when recording sessions began in Atlanta, New Orleans and Seattle, their hometown. Eddie Vedder was increasingly frustrated by the corporate appropriation of grunge, exemplified by the introduction of a Vedder-like character on the TV soap opera General Hospital, played by future pop star Ricky Martin. Vedder and drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who was happy to revel in the band's success, had stopped talking to each other. Meanwhile, the drug and alcohol abuse that was afflicting some of their peers had started seeping into the band. ""I was drunk and making an ass out of myself,"" recalled guitarist Mike McCready. ""I didn't know how to relate to Eddie, and after the band really took off, I went off in my own world.""Vedder's desire for creative control also caused tension. In addition to his lead-singer duties, he had begun playing guitar, turning Pearl Jam into a three-ax army â€“ ""which wasn't an easy transition,"" says producer Brendan O'Brien. ""How do you squeeze everybody in?"" By 1994, Vedder had almost fully taken charge of the band's musical direction â€“ writing more of the songs himself rather than working in collaboration with his bandmates. ""It wasn't a hostile takeover,"" Vedder told Crowe later. ""To be honest, I think that I felt that anything we put out was highly representative of me and because I was kind of becoming the most recognizable guy in the group, I needed to be more represented musically. And if that meant me creating the songs that were going to accomplish that, then I had to do it.""For other members of the band, the new approach was jarring. ""I still don't know if he was consciously exerting wanting to take over the band or take the reins or the power,"" said Ament. Guitarist Stone Gossard sensed the change when he brought in a song he'd recorded on a microcassette. Vedder listened quietly and returned the next day with the same tape, but sped up to a tempo that sounded like a nonstop flyswatter attack. ""He was like, 'Now listen to it, and see if you like that,'"" Gossard said. ""When I wrote that song, it was probably much more of a midtempo stomp, and it ended up being sort of a tear-your-head-off uptempo number.""The eventual product, a tribute to vinyl records called ""Spin the Black Circle,"" was a revved-up thrasher that omitted another Pearl Jam mainstay: a guitar solo. ""We just broke it down to its bare essentials,"" Gossard said. ""We'd just made Vs., and I was like, 'This is it, this is the prototype of how we're going to be as a band. I understand how this is supposed to work.' And suddenly Vitalogy was very different from that. I was worried about that.""In such a fraught atmosphere (McCready checked himself into the Hazelden rehab clinic in Minnesota a few months before Vitalogy's release), it's startling that the band didn't fall apart. But even at that early stage of their career, Pearl Jam were steeped in self-perseverance, and an album that threatened to derail their career wound up lending them a renewed sense of purpose.The stress that had overtaken the group in light of its fame was evident from the start. ""Lives opened and trashed/Look, Ma, watch me crash,"" Vedder sang on Vitalogy's unrelenting first track, ""Last Exit."" It was far from the only song that found him grappling with his magazine-cover-idol status. Feelings of being overwhelmed fueled ""Tremor Christ,"" and the one-minute-and-one-second ""Pry, To"" featured Vedder taunting ""P-R-I-V-A-C-Y is priceless to me"" four straight times.Inspired by seeing a replica of one of his favorite jackets selling for hundreds of dollars in a fashion store, ""Corduroy"" lashed out at the exploitation of Pearl Jam's alt-rock community. As Vedder said, ""The music was getting co-opted at every turn. At the time, that freaked me out."" A brooding slow-burner with a crashing-waves chorus, ""Immortality"" was interpreted as a comment on Kurt Cobain, who committed suicide during the album's sessions. ""It's not about Kurt,"" Vedder said at the time. ""But I think there might be some things in the lyrics that you could read into and maybe will answer some questions or help you understand the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.""Even more ferociously defiantâ€¨ was ""Not for You,"" which the band premiered â€¨on Saturday Night Live months before itsâ€¨release. Vedder's voice reached new levels of â€¨roared disgust, and the song embodied the â€¨band's aversion to the entertainment maâ€¨chinery: ""I felt like establishing something inâ€¨ that song,"" Vedder said. ""'This music doesn't â€¨belong to you. You don't feel it like we do. You â€¨don't even know what's really going on here.â€¨ You've never stood in line for a show.'"" On theâ€¨ version cut for Vitalogy, McCready played a â€¨Rickenbacker given to him by Tom Petty, another believer in sticking with one's principles.Along with its coiled intensity, Vitalogy also found Pearl Jam stretched out in ways they hadn't on their first two albums. Almost a grunge lullaby, ""Nothingman"" was a collaboration between Ament, who wrote the music, and Vedder, who supplied the lyrics about a relationship coming undone. ""Aye Davanita"" is nearly three minutes of chanted mumbling and back-porch strumming. Inspired by Vedder's recent bout with poison oak, ""Bugs"" could have been a lost track on a Tom Waits album: Strapping on an accordion, Vedder sings in an increasingly freaked-out voice about insects crawling over him. ""We just decided to do something that was fun to listen to and wasn't bombastic and wasn't everything that the band had become,"" Vedder said.Vedder also exposed some of his private life in ""Better Man,"" about his mother and stepfather and their troubled marriage. Although the song has an inherently strong verse-chorus structure, it came to symbolize the second-guessing that permeated Pearl Jam at the time. Originally intended for Vs., ""Better Man"" was dropped from that album. Later, when the band played it onstage in Atlanta, O'Brien was so stunned by the power of the performance that he used parts of that recording for a new version of the song. Even then, Vedder almost yanked it off Vitalogy, feeling the chorus was ""too happy."" A new, quieter intro, with Vedder on guitar and O'Brien on organ, was quickly recorded. ""I, personally, was stressed out almost the whole time,"" said O'Brien. ""I was trying my best to keep it positive, but it was a stressful time. ... They were sort of imploding a little bit internally.""Late in the sessions, Abbruzzese was fired in what he later called an ""unceremonious and disrespectful way,"" and the band brought on a new drummer, former Red Hot Chili Pepper Jack Irons. Irons' first task was contributing to the band's strangest recording ever. Stretching out past seven minutes, the track called either ""Stupid Mop"" or ""Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me"" (depending on where one looked in the credits) blended voices of mental-hospital patients â€“ which Vedder had taped off his TV when he was a teenager â€“ with an improvised backing track. Vedder called it ""our most emotional and moving song,"" but the head-scratching sound collage, the album's closing cut, became one of the most debated moments in the band's history.This eccentric impulse extended to their late-game decision to change the album title from ""Life"" to Vitalogy, a name taken from a health care manual published in 1899. At a cost of $2 million, the group packaged the CD in an imitation of the century-old book, complete with a table of contents, an open letter to then-President Bill Clinton about the shooting death of an abortion doctor, and reproductions of illustrations and a glossary from the original Vitalogy book.""At first I didn't think it had any continuity,"" McCready said of the finished LP. ""It was weird. When I heard the final album, I didn't really like it, which may have been because I was so fucked up when we recorded it."" Gossard said he felt ""kind of disappointed"" hearing it.Eccentric or not, Vitalogy sold nearly 900,000copies in its first week. By dismantling their sound and wandering a newartistic path, Pearl Jam were reborn and more confident than ever. ""Inretrospect,"" Gossard said, ""thank God that we made a record that allof a sudden had this different energy.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,David Fricke,2017-12-04T16:48:00.000Z,"Eric Clapton Talks Addiction, Cream's Brilliance, the Future of the Guitar","eric clapton, eric clapton interview, eric clapton rolling stone, eric clapton david fricke, eric clapton documentary, eric clapton racist, eric clapton retired, eric clapton cream",Rolling Stone,"There is a remarkable scene early in Eric Clapton:&nbsp;Life in 12 Bars, the new Showtime documentary about the guitarist's career, that sums up his meteoric rise as a British-blues prodigy and worldwide superstar: Bob Dylan in a London hotel room in 1965 watching John Mayall's Bluesbreakers on television and raving over that band's guitarist â€“ Clapton, now 72, then barely out of his teens. ""I still can't believe that's real,"" Clapton says, laughing, in a New York hotel lobby the day after a screening. ""I thought, 'Oh, that must be Photoshop-ed.'""Directed by Lili Fini Zanuck, Life in 12 Bars also has extraordinary footage of Clapton onstage with Cream in the Sixties and revealing interviews with the women in his life including his grandmother Rose â€“ who raised him after Clapton's 16-year-old mother, Patricia, left England with his father, a Canadian airman â€“ and first wife Pattie Boyd, the object of Clapton's romantic obsession on 1970's Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. The film is unflinching, too, about the deep blues inside those he sang, with painfully frank sequences on Clapton's battles with heroin, alcohol and the accidental 1991 death of his young son Conor, which inspired the Grammy-winning ballad ""Tears in Heaven."" But Clapton is also facing forward, working on his next studio album. ""I'm in the middle of it,"" he reveals, noting that ""it started with the leftover"" from the cache of rare and previously unrecorded demos that formed the basis of his 2014 covers tribute, The Breeze: An Appreciation of JJ Cale. ""I still have some JJ songs that we're playing with. ""Sometimes we mix them with dub, sometimes we take it back to pure country."" Clapton is writing new material as well with his studio collaborator and keyboard player Simon Climie.""And then I'll do some shows next year,"" Clapton declares late in this interview, conducted for the current issue of Rolling Stone and greatly expanded here in depth, range and candor. In fact, two weeks after this conversation, the guitarist announced a huge outdoor show on July 8th with special guests Santana, Steve Winwood and Gary Clark Jr. in London's Hyde Park â€“ the site of Clapton's live debut with Blind Faith in 1969. But, he insists, ""I don't see it as touring anymore â€“ just one date at a time."" You saw the film again yesterday. What is it like to walk through your life like that? It's not as bad as the first time I saw it. I was in an editing room. There was one scene that I was really uncertain about, which was the semi-racial thing that went down during my worst period. I made remarks onstage about foreigners [at a show in Birmingham, England in 1976]. Being the drunk that I was, I just went on a rant. Did you ask Lili to take it out?  I just have to face the guy that I became when I was fueled on drugs and alcohol. It's incomprehensible to me, in a way, that I got so far out. And there was no one to challenge me. Because I may have become quite intimidating. People said they couldn't challenge me because I came back twice as strong.  The only guy who did was my manager [at the time], Roger Forrester. He said to me, ""You've got a problem."" When I decided he was right, he was the person I called. He packed me up and sent me off to [the rehab facility] Hazelden. When I got to Hazelden, I had to sign this thing saying who is your significant other. Anyone else would have put a family member â€“ or my wife. I was married. But I put him. Because he was the only one who would stand up to me and call me out.The first part of the film is about how you became a musician. The second is about how music saved you at every turn â€“ from obsession, drugs, alcohol and even the death of your son. When things were at rock bottom, you always had the guitar. I would add one thing â€“ listening to music became just as important as being able to play. During all of those periods of my life, I found new or old music that helped me, that got me through even when I wasn't playing well or I wasn't playing at all. It might be Maria Callas singing or the playing of [Delta bluesman] Tommy McClennan. I remember coming out of the smack period [in the early Seventies] â€“ anything I heard would reduce me to tears, especially if it came from the heart. The music from Carousel still does bring me to tears.That clip of Dylan watching you on TV with John Mayall is an example of the incredible happenstance in your life. You lived at a historic intersection of cultural forces in the Sixties. And you participated in them, because you actually had the gift. It was a good time. Lili and I were talking about it again today, about how free that period was in the Sixties and early Seventies. There wasn't a consciousness about what would be successful or not. It didn't matter as long as you took a shot at everything and just kept on playing. And if anyone came in, [they could] join in. It was open.By the time I got to the Nineties, I was really confused about the competitive nature of music. Bands were aggressive to one another, judgmental. You just make records and hope that they do better than the other guy's records. In that point you're talking about, anything could happen, and it had nothing to do with success.The film opens with your video tribute to B.B. King after he died in 2015. It sets a tone too: Many of the faces and voices in the movie â€“ Duane Allman, Cream's Jack Bruce, George Harrison, your friend and Cream roadie Ben Palmer â€“ are gone. I don't want to even think about that. I'm determined to stick around as long as I can. I'm watching everything. I go to the doctor's at the slightest sign of anything.How is your health? On the back cover of your last album, I Still Do, there is a photo of you playing guitar with a fingerless glove on your hand.I had eczema from head to foot. The palms of my hand were coming off, and I had just started making this record with [producer] Glyn Johns. It was a catastrophe. I had to wear mittens with Band-Aids around the hands and played a lot of slide [guitar] as a result.When I saw you in concert this year, in the spring and fall, there were no gloves. My hands are good. It hasn't gone completely, but I put ointment on. It's just getting old now. I'm as good now as I've been in the last two years.Have you ever considered the possibility that, because of illness or age, you couldn't play guitar again?That would be alright. I would accept it. Because playing is difficult anyway. I have to get on the bottom of the ladder every time I play guitar, just to tune it. Then I have to go through the whole threshold of getting calluses [on the fingers] back, coordination.But the guitar comes up a lot in the film as a place of refuge for you. I still go there. If there is trouble in the house, which is very rare, I pick up my guitar and remove myself from the situation. I will inevitably play something bland, an exercise. But it will keep me from being engaged in the conflict.Is that something you recognized as a boy?  I became acquainted with it pretty quick, because I would go to it immediately. I would always go to that place to find some peace. It would always be a staple for stress.Yet you did have a thing about attachment â€“ leaving the Yardbirds and Mayall, breaking up Cream and Derek and the Dominos. Ben [Palmer] says that [in the film] â€“ I could achieve very strong relationships, and the next day I'd be gone. Yeah, that is peculiar. But it was never like that with the music. To this day, I can return to the stuff that I first heard, and it will have the same effect on me that it did then. There is a section of the film where Cream is playing at the Fillmore; we're playing around Ginger [Baker]'s drum solo ...""Toad."" It was so good. We were playing so well together. And watching that, I thought if only they [Baker and Bruce] could have found a way to resolve their conflict. I was having the time of my life musically. But like Ben said, the bickering was outrageous. I don't know if you could fairly say which one it was, or if it was my inability to take part. Maybe it wasn't the same guy all the time.At least one of you was crazy at some point in the day. Exactly. But the music was getting so refined that it made it alright.One of the shots in the film that I like â€“ and it goes by in an instant â€“ is the photo of the Crawdaddy Club in London, where the Yardbirds played. And there are two guys ...&nbsp;Climbing on the ceiling.It looks like a punk-rock moshpit. It really was.People who see you in arenas now might not realize you made your bones in these wild environments. We were club musicians â€“ low-ceiling places where you'd share a dressing room with the other band. When you came in, they were taking their trousers off. Very tight, small places â€“ that was what I was most comfortable with. Doing arenas â€“ I'm still not used to it. I like to create a little space in front of me where I think I'm playing in a little room.How do you do that in the Garden? I look at the exit signs [laughs]. I look somewhere in the back, into the darkness, and I think, ""Oh, I'm in the Marquee"" or ""I'm in the Flamingo Club.""You also have that open space, when you solo in blues numbers like ""Little Queen of Spades,"" where you seem most free as a player. That's always there for me. I have to maintain that. Any time it gets into set pieces, I don't really want to be there. It's another version of ""For Your Love"" [the Yardbirds' 1965 pop hit â€“ Clapton played on the record but quit before it came out]. Anytime I can play free, it is in 12 bars. That's a good title [for the film]. It's the way I approach everything. It's the most difficult thing to write, a modern blues. The only person I know who can do it well is Robert Cray. It comes straight out of him. I saw him recently this year, and he's still doing it. He's on fire, the real thing. I wish I could be like that. Really, I'm a musician. I try to be a singer and songwriter, and it's interesting to me. But I would never think of myself as that. I'm just a blues musician.Would you consider ""Tears in Heaven"" a blues? The circumstances would suggest that. It isn't. I was trying to write [Jimmy Cliff's ] ""Many Rivers to Cross"" or [Bob Marley's] ""No Woman, No Cry."" It's the same chord progression. I don't know if I could express what I'm feeling in a blues, because a blues is at a level of anger and self-pity. And this was different.There is a great B.B. quote in the film in which he describes the way you play a blues solo as ""like putting pieces in a puzzle.""  That's how I see it. I create a portion of time for a beginning and an end. It has to make sense, make a picture. If left to my own devices in the studio, I will go over and over and over until I think it is as refined as it can be. ""Layla"" was like that, like building a puzzle.Is the puzzle ever complete? It's never complete. But I remember one night in Philadelphia with Cream. It was near the end of our touring together [in 1968]. We knew it was over. We were just having a good time playing. And I remember thinking ""This is as great as it will ever be."" Have I ever been satisfied? Definitely for one night, yeah.Ed Sheeran has said that you were the reason he started playing guitar. What do you say to younger artists like him about navigating the perils of success?I don't think you say anything, to be honest [laughs]. He has asked my advice. And what I've said to him is, ""Slow down. Don't burn it all up too fast."" But he seems to be committed to go as far as he can. He wants to conquer the globe. But what do you do then? Where do you go from there? It can't always be up â€“ for anybody.How do you look back on your stardom in the Sixties and Seventies? You had pursuit of the music without worrying about the celebrity â€“ as if the work was enough. We didn't consider what we were doing as business. I always use Cream as an example. We were just told where to go. We didn't have time to think about how much money we were making, what was the right strategy, which town you should go to. Now you have guys like Ed who direct and produce their own shows. The music is part of that. But we couldn't have done it that way then. It would have been a distraction.What do you do to get away from the business â€“ the distractions from your craft? I have a business manager who talks to me almost daily about what we should be doing, like how we're managing Crossroads [Clapton's addiction treatment center in Antigua]. A lot of the time, I've told people to leave me alone, because I need to play. And it isn't easy. It takes a lot of devotion to get to the point where what I'm playing is presentable. When I was young, it was easy to get to that place. I had no relationships, no children, no business. I had nothing to worry about but play. Now there are all these things which I'm happy to be responsible for. But it does distract me from what makes it all possible.We've talked before about the future of the guitar. Some people think the instrument has said what it needs to say in the culture, in music. Do you believe it still has a future as an expressive force? And what would you say to a young player looking for an original voice in there, especially going up against icons like yourself, B.B. and Jimi Hendrix? This is funny, because I've had a conversation about this phenomenon just a while ago. In the last few months, I've been talking to a guy who doesn't know where to go next. It was a conversation with a young musician who contacted me through some friends. I could see that he was genuine and I was interested in what he had to offer. Finally we had lunch and he said, ""Do you want to listen to something?"" It was esoteric and abstract, and I thought, ""Where would this go?""I wanted the guy to be taken somewhere. I could hear that he was in his own head too much, and that can be a cul de sac. There is always something to listen to, to aspire to, with the guitar. It is still the most flexible instrument. You can improvise on it. You have such freedom. I don't think there is a limit to it.That is heartening. Because I love guitars â€“ the more, the merrier.Me too [smiles]. Anyone who talks about it [the guitar as a spent force] should listen to Roebuck Staples [founding guitarist of the Staples Singers]. It is so moving. And that's in the past. So it's not about what's to be. It's already there. If you can get in touch with that, you can do anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,Maura Johnston,2018-01-29T22:13:00.000Z,What Do the Grammys Have Against Women?,"kesha, lorde, #metoo",Rolling Stone,"While much of the chatter surrounding Sunday's Grammy ceremony centered on Kesha, Janelle MonÃ¡e&nbsp;and other women who raised their voices (and wore white roses) in support of #MeToo and Time's Up, the night's&nbsp;winners list told a different story. Of the eight awards presented during the telecast, only one â€“ Best New Artist â€“ was given to a woman, Alessia Cara; the full list of 84 categories, which included solo artists and bands, songwriting committees and liner-notes scribes, didn't fare much better, percentage-wise. The disconnect between the message of female empowerment and the reality of male dominance made for a jarring viewing experience, even with the full awareness that this was, after all, the Grammys, with their innate, bordering-on-absurd conservatism that, more often than not, seems like a core feature instead of a bug â€“ from Bruno Mars' 24-karat retro-R&amp;B sweep over more political offerings like Kendrick Lamar's Damn. and Jay-Z's 4:44 to the persistence of ""name"" acts in the lower reaches of the winners' list. But as MonÃ¡e said during her succinct, powerful speech introducing Kesha, ""Just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us well."" Unpacking the Grammys' innate biases is a crucial step in figuring out how to improve gender dynamics not just within the music industry, but within the culture it entertains.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few questions, for starters: Why was Lorde, whose big-sky party chronicle Melodrama was up for Album of the Year, reportedly the only nominee not offered a solo performance slot â€“ sources say she was asked to participate in a group Tom Petty tribute â€“ while old-guard male acts like Sting and U2, neither 2018 nominees, got multiple chances to mug for the camera in unmediated fashion? Why was Julia Michaels, up for two of the night's Big Four cross-genre awards â€“ Song of the Year and Best New Artist â€“ relegated to Kesha's backing choir? How did Ed Sheeran's leering ""Shape of You"" beat ""Praying"" and the rest of the all-female Best Pop Solo performance field? And why, as MonÃ¡e pointed out on Twitter on Saturday, have only 9.3 percent of the Grammy nominees in the past five years been women?A reporter for Variety asked National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences president Neil Portnow about the gender disparity in this year's Grammy hoopla, and his answer was muddled yet revealing:""It has to begin withâ€_ women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive levelâ€_ [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome. I don't have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it's upon us â€“ us as an industry â€“ to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.""This response is startling on multiple levels, particularly from someone who purports to represent the whole of the recorded-music business, and who surely scrutinizes the Grammy nominations lists up close. While he somewhat admirably talks about his lack of personal experience with ""brick walls,"" if he's listened even faintly to women in the business, Portnow must know that simply stepping forward when the proverbial welcome mat is rolled out and mustering up as much heart and soul as possible won't solve the problem. Stories about women being disrespected by country-radio employees and journalists and other colleagues on levels ranging from the embarrassing to the egregious abound; relative newcomers like Lorde and seasoned performers like BjÃ¶rk have both noted how male collaborators are often granted ""Svengali"" status when they work with female artists, but not male artists. Women can ""step up,"" as Portnow put it, but breaking what is clearly a glass ceiling requires much more than a single move forward â€“ it requires systemic change that might cause discomfort.  Others chalked up the lack of female winners to the dearth of megastars releasing music during the 2018 ceremony's nomination period like BeyoncÃ©, Rihanna and Taylor Swift, about whom Grammy telecast producer Ken Ehrlich said, ""Hopefully we'll see her next year."" Not only does that ruthlessly celebrity-first sentiment diminish the artistic achievements of SZA (a first-time nominee with five nods), Kesha, Lady Gaga and other women who went home empty-handed, assuming Swift is a slam-dunk is a bit of a stretch: While Swift's Reputation came out in November â€“ far past the Grammy's September 30th cut-off date for eligibility â€“ she was nominated in two categories in this year's awards. She lost in both: The Lin-Manuel Mirandaâ€“penned ""How Far I'll Go"" from Moana topped her Fifty Shades Darker duet with Zayn, ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever"" (which she performed and co-wrote), while Chris Stapleton's ""Broken Halos,"" credited to Stapleton and Americana songwriter Mike Henderson, beat out the Swift-written Little Big Town song ""Better Man"" for Best Country Song.Lorde, perhaps bolstered by the optimism of youth, used her silence, social-media savvy and keen knowledge of the celebrity-media panopticon wisely. Attached to the back of her siren-red gown was a card emblazoned, in spidery handwriting, with a piece by spectacle-minded artist Jenny Holzer. Part of Holzer's 1979â€“82 project Inflammatory Essays, the work, like others in the project, originally appeared on wheat-pasted posters around Manhattan â€“ probably not far from where Lorde sat on Sunday night. ""Rejoice! Our times are intolerable,"" it begins. Then:""Take courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best. Only dire circumstance can precipitate the overthrow of oppressors. The old and corrupt must be laid to waste before the just can triumph ... the reckoning will be hastened by the staging of seed disturbances. The apocalypse will blossom.""When Holzer embarked on Inflammatory Essays, which also contains posters that open with ""Thou are that kind of privileged woman who is really really sure that nothing will ever happen to thee"" and ""When you become rich, death sniffs the air and starts circling,"" she honed her voice by researching polemicists like Vladimir Lenin and Emma Goldman as well as ""various religious and right-wing fanatics,"" as she said in a 1986 interview. Not all of the writings necessarily mirrored her beliefs, except that she wanted to ""write things that were very hot â€“ in tone and subject matter â€“ to (hopefully) instill a sense of urgency in the reader."" Think of it as a pre-commercial web version of a hot take, complete with a desired, if vague, outcome that resembles the goals of a hashtag campaign: ""I wanted the reader to jump, at least,"" Holzer said, ""and maybe consider doing something useful."" Lorde may not have uttered a word on last night's telecast, but her presence â€“ and absence, too â€“ spoke volumes. Whether or not the music industry will more widely ""consider doing something useful"" in response to the resulting outcry, however, remains to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch our recap of the best and worst moments of the 2018 Grammy Awards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,Patrick Doyle,2017-12-05T22:52:20.849Z,Noel Gallagher on New Solo LP: 'It's About Everything the Terrorists Hate',"Noel Gallagher, Liam Gallagher, Oasis, Don't Look Back in Anger, oasis manchester, dont look back in anger manchester, noel gallagher oasis, noel gallagher high flying birds, noel gallagher interview",Rolling Stone,"Noel Gallagher has become a little more comfortable with Oasis' legacy lately. He brightens up while discussing how, after the success of last year's documentary Oasis: Supersonic, he's been seeing younger faces in his audiences. Gallagher describes playing an intimate acoustic set, where a group of young girls got emotional during his old songs. ""I stopped them after the gig and said, 'How old are you two?' They were like 15. I was like, 'Are you just getting into Oasis now?' They said yeah. Isn't that fucking amazing? I guess the longer it goes and the younger that I see people getting into it, it means that somehow, by some trick or act of fucking god, we did something as a band, or I did something somewhere that was timeless,"" he tells Rolling Stone.&nbsp;""Looking back on it, it's a mind-blowing thing.""Noel wanted to bring that enthusiasm into the studio when he made Who Built the Moon?&nbsp;â€“ his third album with his band the High Flying Birds since 2011 and the heaviest LP he's put out since his Oasis days. ""It's the most energetic thing I've done,"" he says. ""I always found it kind of difficult for me to [communicate] joy in music. It's very easy, particularly in this day in age, to write about angst and how life is so difficult. To find a fucking joy in the world and then to kind of crystalize it into music is difficult, and not many people can do it. I've done it once or twice in 25 years. So when it happens, it's special.""Despite its upbeat vibe, the album was made in a solemn place â€“ Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the dead of winter. ""It was fucking snowing everyday,"" Gallagher says. He had been working on 2015's stripped-down Chasing Yesterday, and asked David Holmes, a Northern Irish electronic musician, to take those songs in a different direction. Holmes turned him down, saying the album sounded finished. ""He said, 'Let's make another record.' And I said, 'What about the songs?' He said, 'Don't worry about the songs, write them in the studio.' And I was like, 'Fuck that, I've never done that before.'""  But they did. Gallagher was inspired to throw out his usual playbook, putting down the acoustic guitar and writing songs in other ways, drawing from samples. ""Dave would say, 'Sounds a bit like Oasis,' and I'd say, 'Fucking great!' And then he'd say, 'Come on, try something different.'""&nbsp;They decided to pull generously from Gallagher's influences. ""If Love is the Law"" was written during a heavy phase spent listening to Genesis' 1969 deep cut ""The Conqueror."" ""I became obsessed with early Genesis, and I was like, 'Fuckin' hell, why has no one ever fuckin' mentioned this?' ""Holy Mountain"" borrows a hook from the extremely obscure Sixties bubblegrum group the Ice Cream. ""That might be one of the best things I've ever fuckin' heard in my life,"" says Gallagher. ""Dave said, 'Do you think you could write a song around it?' And I went, 'If it fuckin' kills me.'"" Gallagher is also proud of ""She Taught Me How to Fly,"" a pulsating ode to inescapable love. ""It's clearly the greatest lost Blondie single of time,"" he says.""It's unashamedly a fuckin' pop record,"" says Gallagher of the album. ""It's about the joy of beautiful women, nights out and nights getting fuckin' high, and all the things that we live in life. All the things that the fuckin' terrorists hate. I reckon if I went to Syria and played it for Isis, it'd all be fuckin' over. I reckon it'd even turn Trump around."" The conversations turns to Manchester, where ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" becoming a healing anthem after the May concert bombing that killed 23 people. ""I'm sitting in my lounge in the very spot when I was watching the news when there was the minute silence in St. Ann's Square, and just a lone girl started singing it and the crowd joined in,"" Gallagher says. ""I don't get speechless. I've gotta say, I sat there and I was like, 'Holy fuck.' Then, as the weeks passed, it kind of reignited my faith in music because regardless of whether it's my song or not, I was like, 'Fuck, it is important, man. These people are rallying around this song.' I'm still speechless about it. I wrote that song so long ago ... and it's taken on a different meaning now. It's been adopted by the people like a flag of defiance.""Offhand, Rolling Stone mentions Stop the Clocks, the Oasis best-of compilation that highlights just how many earworms the band had. ""We did some fucking good stuff,"" Gallagher says. ""I mean, I lost my way a little bit in '98 until 2003, 2004, that's the truth. When you have so much fame and so much success, you kind of sit back and think, 'Why am I doing this now? I don't need the fucking money, I don't need the fame, I don't need the glory. Whatever it was, it went away for a bit, I didn't have anything to write about. But it came back. We did some shit stuff, but we did some good stuff as well.""  In a recent interview for RS'&nbsp;Music Now podcast, Liam seemed to extend an olive branch to his brother in regards to a reunion, saying, ""I would prefer to be speaking about an Oasis album than a Liam solo album.

89,Dan Epstein,2017-10-28T14:00:00.000Z,Queen's 'News of the World': 10 Things You Didn't Know,"queen, freddie mercury, queen we are the champions, queen we will rock you, we will rock you, we are the champions, queen sex pistols, sid vicious freddie mercury, brian may, freddie mercury",Rolling Stone,"Though now rightly regarded as one of the greatest rock bands of all time, Queen were experiencing something of a midlife crisis in the summer of 1977, when Freddie Mercury, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor reconvened to begin work on their sixth studio album.Their previous record, 1976's A Day at the Races, had peaked at Number Five in the U.S. and topped the charts in the U.K. â€“ but it had also sold considerably fewer copies than their 1975 blockbuster, A Night at the Opera. Reviews of the album and its accompanying North American and U.K. tour dates had not been particularly kind, either; in a Rolling Stone review from February 24th, 1977, Dave Marsh wrote of the band, ""They have managed to borrow all that's frothiest from their influences, from the fake-orgasmic vocal contortions of Robert Plant to the semi-vaudevillian pop of the Beach Boys and Beatles. In addition, to cement their 'seriousness,' they use instrumental effects which hint at opera in the same way that bad movie music palely evokes the symphony.""To make matters worse, the rise of punk and New Wave was also calling into question the relevance of Seventies arena rock, and Queen suddenly found themselves cast as dinosaurs whose epoch of dominance was rapidly fading. Rather than double down with another lavishly overdubbed studio creation, the band responded by recording the most stripped-down and straightforward album of their career, one which went for a leaner, more spontaneous sound and feel while still retaining the melodic flamboyance and hard-rock heft of their multi-layered earlier work. The resulting LP, News of the World, was released on October 28th, 1977; thanks in part to the two-sided smash of ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions,"" it has gone on to become the best-selling album of the band's career, moving more than 4 million copies in the U.S. alone. (A deluxe box-set reissue of News of the World is due out on November 17th.)On the 40th&nbsp;anniversary of the album's original release, here are 10 things you probably didn't know about News of the World.1.&nbsp;The album&nbsp;was primarily recorded in the same studio where the Sex Pistols were finishing Never Mind the Bollocks, leading to some memorable encounters between the two bands.Most of News of the World's tracks were cut at London's Wessex Studios, an arrangement which put the band on a collision course with British punks the Sex Pistols, who were working in the same studio complex on their landmark debut album. ""We used to bump into them in the corridors,"" guitarist Brian May recalled to Queen biographer Mark Blake. ""I had a few conversations with John Lydon, who was always very respectful. We talked about music.""Less respectful was Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious, who made the mistake one day of bursting into Queen's control room and antagonizing their frontman. ""Ah, Freddie Mercury,"" sneered Sid. ""Have you succeeded in bringing ballet to the masses, then?"" ""Oh, yes, Simon Ferocious,"" Mercury replied. ""We're trying our best, dear."" Then, according to Queen biographer Daniel Nester, Freddie rose from his chair and began to playfully flick the safety pins displayed on the front of Sid's leather jacket. ""Tell me,"" he asked, ""did you arrange these pins just so?"" When Sid stepped forward in an attempt to intimidate Freddie, the singer simply pushed him backwards and inquired, ""What are you going to do about it?"" Sid immediately backed down.2. Though the song ""Sheer Heart Attack"" was widely interpreted as Queen's response to punk rock, the song originates from sessions from the 1974 album of the same name.All four members of Queen contributed songs to News of the World, with drummer Roger Taylor bringing in ""Sheer Heart Attack"" and ""Fight from the Inside,"" two of the album's tougher tracks. While many listeners pegged the hard-driving, feedback-laced ""Sheer Heart Attack"" as a response (or salute) to the burgeoning punk movement, the song's origins can actually be traced back to the waning glam-rock days of 1974, when the band was working on their third studio album. ""We came up with the title for the Sheer Heart Attack album, and it was a song that I had an idea for, but I hadn't actually finished the song, yet,"" Taylor recalled on Rockline in 1991. ""By the time I had finished the song, we were two albums later, so it just struggled out on the News of the World album. It's quite interesting, because we were making an album next door to a punk band, the Sex Pistols, and it really fit into that punk explosion that was happening at the time. ... It was actually better that it happened that it came out on the News of the World album.""3. ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions"" were both inspired by a particularly raucous Queen concert.News of the World opens with the stomping chant ""We Will Rock You,"" followed immediately by the rousing ballad ""We Are the Champions"" â€“ the latter of which peaked at Number Two in the U.K. and Number Four in the U.S. as a single, though both songs were often played back to back on American radio. Now long established as ""jock jams"" classics, the songs were actually inspired by the band's fans, specifically those who gave Queen a particularly warm and rowdy reception during a show at Stafford's Bingley Hall on May 29th, 1977. ""'We Will Rock You' was a response to a particular phase in Queen's career, when the audience was becoming a bigger part of the show than we were,"" May explained to Guitar World in 2002. ""They would sing all the songs. And in a place like [Bingley Hall], they'd be so vociferous that we'd have to stop the show and let them sing to us. So, both Freddie and I thought it would be an interesting experiment to write a song with audience participation specifically in mind."" May went on to write ""We Will Rock You"" in response, while Freddie Mercury penned ""We Are the Champions.""4. The rest of the band initially thought Freddie's ""We Are the Champions"" was too ""big headed"" to include on the album.""I was thinking about football when I wrote it,"" Freddie Mercury told Circus in 1978, when asked about ""We Are the Champions."" ""I wanted a participation song, something that the fans could latch on to. Of course, I've given it more theatrical subtlety than an ordinary football chant."" But for all the inherent grandiosity of Queen's music and live performances, the rest of the band were taken aback by when Freddie first presented them with the song, initially believing that its message was unbecomingly arrogant, even for them. ""Our initial sense of it was that it was something very big headed,"" May told Guitar World in 2008. ""We all looked at Fred and said, 'Really?' But he had a very clear view of it. It was aimed at an audience that wanted to feel a togetherness and a power and an optimism. He knew people would sing it.""5. Brian May's guitar solo on ""We Are the Champions"" was a last-minute addition to the track.The triumphant guitar solo that ends ""We Are the Champions"" is one of Brian May's most iconic recorded moments, but the version that originally graced the song was actually much different. ""I had done the guitar for that fairly early on,"" May told Guitar for the Practicing Musician in 1993. ""Everyone said, 'That's fine.' Normally the person who wrote the song did the mix, which was the case in this instance; Freddie was mixing the thing. I took a cassette tape of it home halfway through, and they were going to finish it off in the morning.""But upon listening to the rough mix that night, May became unhappy with how ""weak"" his solo sounded in the context of the almost-finished song. ""So I said, 'Look, Fred, I have to get back and do that.' I redid everything, and there's a little piece towards the end when I was trying to make the guitar sing along with Freddie's vocals. He was really pushing himself on the vocals at the end, so I tried to push the guitar and express the way I felt. It's hardly audible on the record. It's not like a major feature, but you can hear the guitar and the vocal are kind of straining against each other. ... It's a nice moment which is captured.""6. Brian May drew upon his physics education to create the massive stomping and clapping sounds on ""We Will Rock You.""Before he achieved rock stardom, Brian May studied mathematics and physics at Imperial College London, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics in 1968. And as he explained to NPR's Terry Gross in 2010, he put that education to good use when building the rhythm track for ""We Will Rock You."" ""We were working in an old, disused church in North London, and it already had a nice sound,"" he recalled. ""And there were some old boards lying around, but they just seemed ideal to stamp on. So we piled them up and started stamping. And they sounded great anyway. But being a physicist, I said, 'Suppose there were 1,000 people doing this; what would be happening?' And I thought, 'Well, you would be hearing them stamping. You would also be hearing a little bit of an effect, which is due to the distance that they are from you.' So I put lots of individual repeats on them. Not an echo but a single repeat at various distances. And the distances were all prime numbers. ... When we recorded each track, we put a delay of a certain length on it. And none of the delays were harmonically related. So there's no echo on it whatsoever, but the clapped sound â€“ they spread around the stereo, but they also kind of spread from a distance from you â€“ so you just feel like you're in the middle of a large number of people stamping and clapping.""7. ""All Dead, All Dead"" was partly inspired by the death of Brian May's cat.Sung by Brian May, the lilting, melancholy track ""All Dead, All Dead"" sounds like a farewell to a departed lover, but it was at least partly inspired by the death of the guitarist's childhood cat. ""It was a song I had around for a while,"" May recalled during an appearance on In the Studio with Redbeard. ""It was kind of about the passing of friends ... and I think the thing that started it off was my cat, losing my cat. My cat died when I was a kid, and I kind of never got over it. I think it was one of those things which surfaces now and again in different ways. I think I wrote the song for the album thinking that I was writing it about something completely different â€“ but I think part of it was sort of getting it out of my system.""8. ""Sleeping on the Sidewalk"" is the only song in the entire Queen catalog to be recorded in a single take.Despite their reputation for studio excess, Queen recorded and mixed News of the World in a relatively short period of time, taking only 10 weeks to complete the LP. (A Day at the Races had taken five months.) Though there was an urgency to the sessions, spurred in part by the knowledge that the album needed to be out in time for a six-week North American tour beginning in November, most of the band found the spontaneous nature of the process refreshing. And certainly, no track on News of the World&nbsp;â€“ or indeed, the entire Queen catalog â€“ was as spontaneous as ""Sleeping on the Sidewalk,"" a loose-limbed blues shuffle whose backing track was recorded by May, Roger Taylor and bassist John Deacon in a single take.""Although I messed around with the take a lot and chopped it and rearranged it, it was basically the first take, which we used,"" May told BBC Radio One in 1983. ""It has that kind of sloppy feel that I think works with the song, which we never would have dreamed with the previous albums. We always used to work on the backing tracks until they were a million percent perfect, and if they weren't, we would splice together two which were. We'd go to great lengths, but for this album, we wanted to get that spontaneity back in.""9. Brian May's utilized two-handed tapping for his solo on ""It's Late,"" several months before Van Halen's 1978 debut popularized the technique.Two-handed tapping â€“ when a guitarist hammers strings on the fretboard with fingers from both hands to create a melodic counterpoint â€“ has been around since the Sixties, but it became an enormously popular practice among hard rock and metal shredders of the 1980s, thanks to Eddie Van Halen's use of the technique. While Van Halen's 1978 debut rightly turned the guitar world upside down, Brian May had already beaten Eddie to the two-handed punch on record, utilizing the technique for his solo on ""It's Late,"" News of the World's&nbsp;penultimate track.""I stole it from a guy who said that he stole it from Billy Gibbons in ZZ Top,"" May told On the Record in 1982. ""He was playing in some club in Texas, doing hammering stuff. I was so intrigued by it, I went home and played around with it for ages and put it on 'It's Late.'"" But while he was happy with how the solo sounded, May never made two-handed tapping a regular part of his repertoire. ""It was a problem to do onstage,"" he explained. ""I found it was a bit too stiff. ... If I persevered with it, it would probably become second nature, but it wasn't an alleyway which led very far, to my way of thinking. It's a bit gimmicky.""10. The album's cover was painted by noted science-fiction artist Frank Kelly Freas, based on a magazine cover he'd done nearly a quarter century earlier.On the striking gatefold cover of News of the World, a giant robot holds an unconscious Brian May and a bleeding Freddie Mercury aloft, while John Deacon and Roger Taylor spill from its hand and tumble downward. The cover art was painted by acclaimed artist Frank Kelly Freas, who had previously worked for Mad magazine and numerous science-fiction publications. Roger Taylor, a sci-fi fan, was extremely enamored of Freas' cover for the October 1953 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, which showed a giant robot holding the dead body of a man and bore the caption, ""Please ... fix it, Daddy?""At Taylor's urging, the band reached out to Freas and asked him to redo the painting for News of the World. ""When they sent me their four earlier albums,"" Freas recalled to writer Mel Vincent shortly after the record's release, ""I decided to do the drawing before listening to them, because I thought I might just hate them, and it would ruin my ideas."" When he finally got around to listening to it, Freas â€“ a classical music fan â€“ was pleasantly surprised to find he actually enjoyed Queen's music. ""They are firmly grounded in classical music, but they are inventive,"" he raved. ""It's like these guys have absorbed all the quality music they can and then put it all in a bucket and stirred it up.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,TourÃ©,2018-01-23T13:00:00.000Z,Migos: High Times and Heartache With the Three Kings of Hip-Hop,"migos, migos rolling stone, migos interview, offset cardi b, migos rolling stone cover, migos songs, migos new album, migos culture, cardi b, migos culture 2",Rolling Stone,"The hip-hop one-percenter life is a gated mansion in Atlanta that sits on more than two acres and has two Bentleys in front of it, and when you open the front door a cloud of weed smoke punches you in the face. Welcome to the huge, half-empty house owned by Offset of Migos. Some rooms have nothing but clothes on the floor. Some seem to have never been entered. There are still tags on some of the furniture. ""We just thuggin' it out,"" Offset says. ""I been on the road so much I ain't been here."" You can picture him paying for it just yesterday in stacks of crisp new bills because, as he says on ""Bad and Boujee,"" Migos' chart-topping hit from last year, Offset's got a whole lot of new money. In fact, there's about $100,000 of it lying on the bar right now, in rubber-banded hundreds. And on the kitchen counter there's $1.27 million worth of jewelry, including a watch by Audemars Piguet and another by Patek Philippe. ""The watch everybody rap about, I have in real life,"" Offset notes. He's rich beyond his teenage dreams. ""I never knew I would get this big, honestly,"" he says.Migos â€“ or the Migos, as the group usually calls itself â€“ aren't big. They're gigantic. Twenty-six-year-old Offset, his 26-year-old cousin Quavo and Quavo's 23-year-old nephew Takeoff have transcended hip-hop to become shapers of the culture. They're style icons who dress in bold, slim-fitting fashion and usually wear six or seven elaborate diamond chains at once. They helped create the Dab and got everyone from Cam Newton to your dad doing it. Donald Glover featured Migos on his TV series Atlanta and called ""Bad and Boujee"" ""the best song ever."" Migos are arguably the most influential group â€“ in any genre â€“ of the past few years. They've developed a signature rhyme style: short bursts of words in triplet rhythm. Kanye and Drake have borrowed the Migos Flow; other MCs have made it their primary style. (As Takeoff notes, triplet-based rhymes predate Migos â€“ Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Three 6 Mafia were into them back in the Nineties â€“ but the sleek, acrobatic way Migos do them feels new.) Some hip-hop purists complain that the sound is robotic and overused, but they sound like grandpas barking at the neighborhood kids to get off the lawn. There's a popular meme in which fans say Migos are ""better than the Beatles,"" and like the Fab Four, the three Migos have distinct personalities. Quavo (born Quavious Marshall) is the leader and the frontman, charismatic and confident and quick to jump into funny shit-talking. He was a star quarterback in high school who set the Gwinnett County record for most completions in a game, 28. Takeoff (born Kirsnick Ball) is the kind of guy who talks only when he really has something to say. He's low-key until it's time to rhyme, and then he explodes with energy â€“ that is, he ""takes off.""Offset (Kiari Cephus) is deeper, more serious â€“ he's got the gravelly-sounding voice that's just hard. He's had trouble with the law, including a 2011 arrest for larceny and marijuana possession. In 2015, the whole group was arrested on gun and drug charges; Takeoff and Quavo got plea deals, but Offset got eight months in jail, thanks to his priors. That painted Offset, in some minds, as a criminal, an image he rejects. ""I'm not no fucking criminal,"" he says firmly. ""I was young."" He admits to committing crimes as a teenager. He says, ""I was doing shit, but I would hide it from my mama. I would hide my dope from my mama."" He says his time in the streets was part of a business plan â€“ a way to raise seed capital to launch Migos.But all of that is yesterday's news. Right now, it's early December, and Migos are racing to finish Culture II, the follow-up to 2017's platinum-selling Culture. The album is due in three days, and they've got 30 great songs they want to whittle down to 20 or 21 perfect ones, which means there's still a lot to do. Pharrell did some production on the album, Big Sean and Ty Dolla $ign recorded rhymes for it, and Travis Scott contributed vocals. Migos also say Kanye West worked on a number of songs, but they aren't planning to use all of those tracks on Culture II. ""He did more [songs],"" Takeoff says. ""We sitting on them right now, man.""Today, Offset looks classy even as the world is running him ragged. He's dressed in all black â€“ skullcap, turtleneck, leather pants and socks, too. Everything fits as snugly as if he's about to walk in a fashion show. He juggles a visit from his lawyer and calls from managers and producers. There's also a very special guest upstairs right now: his fiancee, Cardi B. The couple met about a year ago at Offset's insistence â€“ while he watched her rise as an artist, his interest grew, then exploded. ""I was like, 'Damn, I am on her!'â€‰"" he says. ""I am like, 'Shit, I like Cardi B!'â€‰"" He had a publicist set up a dinner in New York for a select group of women, including Cardi. Their first date was at the Super Bowl. He says, ""That's a power move!""Cardi swoops down the stairs, her long blond hair flying behind her like a cape. She's late for a flight home to New York, but she stops for a moment before getting in a car and speaks of Offset with sparkles in her eyes. ""He is always taking care of everybody,"" she says. ""Like, you know when you that one person that have the money, he really take care of everybody? He got to take care of his babies, so he overworks himself more than anybody I ever seen."" Offset is constantly talking about money, either his plans to make or to spend it. He loves to floss, but he really loves being able to take care of his family. ""I want to have generational money,"" he says. ""I got three kids, bro. I need all my kids to be educated and wealthy."" His children are eight, two and two. No, the two-year-olds aren't twins. ""I don't want to be one of those rappers who had it but right now they be on a TV show to keep them going,"" Offset says. ""I would rather be out the scene, getting my money on Bitcoin.""Oh, how much do you have in Bitcoin now? ""I don't like to discuss my investments.""OK. Is there an investment that you can discuss?""I bought five houses in Atlanta and I flipped them. Tripled my money. Made, like, $170,000."" Next, he wants to buy a commercial building. In October, at a concert in Philadelphia, Offset proposed to Cardi onstage, in front of thousands. Why do it that way? ""So she wouldn't think I was playing,"" he says. ""Let the world see that shit. I must have spent half a million on that [ring].""Why do you want to marry her?""She is real solid, came from where I came from, did what I did. She's herself, man. I seen her develop from the trenches all the way up, and I like how she did it. I respect her grind as a woman. She came to the game with some gangsta shit. I like that. I fuck with her. That's my baby.""Alas, in early January, Cardi suggested on social media that Offset had cheated on her (though she later deleted the tweet). Around the same time, more than one sex tape, purportedly featuring Offset, leaked online. After Cardi's post, I ask Offset if they're still working on wedding plans. ""We ain't, we ain't planning it right now,"" he says. ""We chilling. We don't got time for that right now."" Asked about what happened, he refuses to discuss it. ""It's my real life,"" he says firmly. ""It ain't no gig. It ain't no fucking game, you know what I'm saying? It ain't no game. It's my life."" Shortly after he said this, Offset got Cardi's name tattooed on his neck. It's around midnight, and we're outside Atlanta's Quality Control studios. The doors of a McLaren slide straight up. Quavo jumps out and exclaims to no one in particular, ""I'm a rock star! But ya already know!"" Quavo heads to Studio C and begins working on a beat while eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes from Magic City, the famous Atlanta strip club. He eats with his right hand while playing an Akai MPK Mini keyboard with his left as DJ Durel, who serves as a tour DJ, producer and engineer, sits beside him, tweaking sounds on his laptop. As he eats, Quavo rolls a blunt, gulps some Hennessy and listens to the beat in progress. He's a genius at coming up with catchy choruses, though he's also a meticulous beatmaker. Over and over, Quavo plays a bit on the Akai, then says, ""Go back, go back,"" then listens and plays a line again. He directs Durel to adjust the track again and again, until finally he's satisfied. It's a funky little beat with some bass and 808, and as it resounds through the studio, Quavo says, ""That's hard!"" â€“ their favorite honorific.Migos recorded much of Culture II in the midst of a world tour, which was a big change for them: Part of the Migos secret sauce is that they record a lot in their individual home studios. ""At home, you comfortable as hell!"" Offset explains. ""You not gonna be like, 'Is this hard?' It's just you in your zone. 'Bad and Boujee' was made at my house!"" He says he recorded his parts with his youngest son sitting on the floor by his leg.In South Africa, they recorded at a resort where monkeys would walk right up and say hello. ""We were just writing in the middle of, like, the jungle,"" Takeoff recalls. ""Our backyard was, like, the trees."" All of this had an impact on what they wrote. In one song, Takeoff says, ""[Quavo] saying 'straight out the jungle, straight out the jungle,' like on a Bob Marley kind of like Jamaican tip. We wouldn't have said that if we wasn't in the environment we was in.""Despite the unusual setting, Culture II has ""the original Migos sound,"" Offset says. ""Club rocking. The beat, the bass is everything. We're not really a slow-down artist. It's light, it's fun, it's lit."" ""It's still trap,"" Takeoff adds. ""We got a little funkier. It's not all the way funk. There's still a Migos vibe."" Offset says their most crucial audience is women. ""Even if it's some gangsta shit, trap shit, the bitches got to like it,"" he says. ""See, 'Bad and Boujee' was really a ladies' record. It made all of them want to stand up a little more and feel a little better about themselves. When you got the women, you got everything. If a nigga needs to know the secret to hits, you need something that the women like.""Over in Studio A, Offset is working on vocals for a different song. Migos usually work separately, then give one another pieces of songs that either get completed or tossed out. Offset likes to record his vocals sitting in a chair beside the console. As the beat plays again and again, he improvises over it. He sounds a lot like James Brown talking smack on a record, the way he sliced through a track rhythmically and aggressively and, at times, incomprehensibly. Over time, Offset starts to hear words emerge. First he spits, ""Had to put my mama in the Maybach,"" then a second later he tries, ""Came from the bottom in the haystack,"" then, ""Working out the pain from the way back, uh.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.""When they were younger, Migos had a 20-minute rule: They wouldn't spend longer than that coming up with a verse. Now, tracks take a little longer, but one key to their sound is that they never write out their lyrics. They just freestyle and see what happens, which prevents them from overthinking things and lets instinct take over. ""We could take the ""We could take the private to L.A.,"" Quavo will say as nonchalantly as you might say, ""We could drive to 7-Eleven.""Migos think a lot about rhythm, about getting every syllable in the exact right place and leaving the perfect amount of space between words. ""I feel like my voice is a snare,"" Quavo says. ""I feel like my voice is a drum. And most important, I feel like my voice is a bass."" Ad-libs are a big part of this; those little interjections between rhyme bars â€“ whether shouts of ""Shine!"" (a reference to jewelry) or signature sound effects like ""bwah,"" ""skrrrt"" or ""brrrup"" â€“ accentuate the rhythm and add catchiness. ""Each beat got its own space where ain't nothing playing for, like, half a second, and that's where you gotta jab the ad-libs in,"" Quavo says. ""Let that motherfucker act like a high-hat or snare.""One reason Migos seem to be so in tune with one another in the studio is that they've been doing this since they were kids. Growing up, Quavo and Offset bonded over familial heartache. When Quavo was in the eighth grade, his mother grew ill. ""She got this staph infection in her leg,"" he says, ""and she was paying all the bills and paying for her medicine. And I watched that, and that really hurt me."" Quavo says his father died when he was five or six, and as his mom battled through pain while still taking care of him and his two older sisters, he decided he had to grow up. ""It just got me focused,"" he says. ""I said, 'I'm-a make it work.' And ever since then it was like magic.""Offset, meanwhile, recalls watching his older brother get locked up. ""People don't know this. He taught me everything I know. He got 15 years in prison, man, when I was in eighth grade. So that fucked me up."" Around that time, he and Quavo began spending endless hours working on their craft, developing their rhyme style. Takeoff joined the group soon after, and the three Migos lived together in the three-bedroom home of Quavo's mother. They put out their first mixtape in 2011, then scored their first hit two years later with ""Versace."" Nowadays, Migos get mobbed whenever they walk down the street, and they spend money like sultans. ""We could take the private to L.A.,"" Quavo will say as nonchalantly as you might say, ""We could drive to 7-Eleven."" Quavo can even afford to do superballer things like buy his mother a big new house for Christmas. He says he actually split the house with Takeoff â€“ Quavo's mom is Takeoff's grandmom â€“ but still. ""She was really, really excited,"" Quavo says. ""She was crying for, like, the whole day.""Along with runaway success has come occasional drama â€“ including a standoff with Chris Brown at last year's BET Awards and two incidents in which they were accused of homophobia. In both instances they apologized, saying, in part, ""We love all people, gay or straight, and we apologize if we offended anyone."" There was also a crazy moment with Joe Budden. Budden is a rapper who until recently was the co-host of a popular Web show called Everyday Struggle. When Migos appeared on the show, Budden dissed them by walking off the set mid-interview, which led to Migos and their crew squaring up. It looked like a brawl was imminent. The resulting video almost broke the Internet. Quavo went on to use ""Joe Budden"" as a synonym for hater â€“ he put that in the chorus of ""Ice Tray,"" a collaboration between Quavo and Lil Yachty from late last year. But now Quavo all but dismisses him. ""I ain't never had no beef with Joe Budden!"" he says. ""I always just been, 'Fuck him.' It's no disrespect when I say, 'Fuck him.' It's not like, 'Fuck him when I see him, let's fuck him up.' It's like a 'Fuck him, I'm not bothering him, he ain't bothering me' type of fuck. It's no beef. He's just a man with bullshit opinions to piss the artists off. And on top of that, he used to be an artist, so he knows what to say to piss us off."" In a video Budden released online, he laughed about the song and said, ""They are trash,"" but reached for comment for this story, he just says, ""I love Lord Quavious."" Around 2 a.m., it's time to leave the studio and head to the strip club. The whole fam â€“ about 15 guys in total â€“ are rolling in an eight-car caravan of expensive rides that includes Offset's Bentley Bentayga, their friend Lil Yachty's Bentley and Quavo's McLaren. We're snaking through dark Atlanta streets in one line, except that Quavo needs to be at the front of the line, so he keeps switching lanes and zooming ahead, running red lights as the engine roars from the back of the beast. Quavo drives confidently. He does everything confidently. When I ask him to name his top five MCs, he lists six â€“ Tupac, Biggie, Jay-Z, Kanye, Gucci Mane, and himself. Quavo delivered several dozen guest verses in 2017, appearing on songs by everyone from Liam Payne to Mary J. Blige. He's dying to be more famous than he already is. ""I want to sit down, actually, with Ellen on the couch,"" he'll say. ""Sit down with Jimmy Kimmel on the couch, sit down with Fallon or something. Really do the things that these real, real major stars doing."" He plans to build himself into a triple threat. ""I want to be part of everything. In high school, I played three sports, and in the industry I'm trying to play three sports as well."" He means making music and acting in and producing movies; he recently said he's working on something inspired by the films he grew up loving: ""Juice, Menace II Society, all the Snoop Dogg movies, Master P movies, I Got the Hook-Up, Baller Blockin' â€“ the Big Tymers movie."" As the McLaren surges ahead at breakneck speed, Quavo catches me pressing my feet hard into the floor, doing the air-brake thing. And someone being ill at ease as he drives fast and wild and high makes no sense to him. ""Don't be nervous!"" he commands. As you can imagine, this does not mollify. A week later, Migos are in a trailer in Los Angeles, smoking and drinking and talking smack before they perform at the red-carpet premiere for Will Smith's widely panned, widely watched Netflix movie, Bright, before heading to a birthday party for Offset. While Offset FaceTimes with Cardi and Yachty grabs a box of Apple Jacks, Quavo begins holding court. He brags that he's going to smoke a blunt in the movie theater. ""Sorry, Will!"" he says. (Later, he makes good on his word.) Takeoff stands to the side rolling his third blunt of the evening. He's constantly rolling. He stops only when the conversation turns to Tupac and Biggie, their feud and their deaths. Then he perks up and, well, he takes off, suddenly talking up a storm, his eyes alive as we discuss theories about who killed them and hip-hop history in general â€“ which is fitting, because the guy is all about music. REL, one of Migos' managers, loves to tell a story about how they got pulled over by the police when Takeoff was around 14. When the officer asked Takeoff what his job was, he said, ""I'm a rapper."" Offset said of Takeoff, ""He is outspoken with the people he fuck with, he love, but he quiet to everyone else. He analyze a lot, that's why I think his raps be so strong. Takeoff got some strong shit. He's just powerful.""At half past midnight, the guys, now joined by Cardi, head to a downtown club for Offset's birthday party. Offset wears a black long-sleeve shirt covered in diamonds made by Saint Laurent for women. It's Liberace-decadent and costs $20,000. They make their way to the stage, where they bop and rhyme along with their own music and show off their jewelry until it's time for one last bauble to flaunt.As the party starts winding down, Offset and Cardiwalk outside, where her birthday gift for him is waiting: a $400,000Rolls-Royce Wraith, in peppermint and white. Offset shouts and dances andslides into the driver's seat. Cardi sits on his lap and they snuggle in thefront seat. They look like a king and a queen exchanging diamonds. ""Ridin'in that peppermint!"" Offset yells. ""Yes, God!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,Andrew Casillas,2017-12-21T16:19:00.000Z,"Natalia Lafourcade on Her Part in Mexico's Pop Canon, Song for Pixar's 'Coco'","natalia lafourcade, natalia lafourcade interview, natalia lafourcade rolling stone, natalia lafourcade coco, coco soundtrack, los macorinos, remember me theme song, pixar coco, pixar theme song, miguel coco",Rolling Stone,"Long before her tearjerking performance in the Coco theme, ""Remember Me,"" Natalia Lafourcade has been the latest in a long line of Mexican singers for whom passion and cultural pride are irrevocably intertwined.&nbsp;Lafourcade's music combines the hope and desire of the soulful Lola BeltrÃ¡n, the classical melancholy of composer AgustÃ_n Lara, and the simplicity and sincerity of ranchera hero JosÃ© Alfredo JimenÃ©z â€“ all while remaining firmly within the contemporary pop landscape.&nbsp;That's not to say that Lafourcade has earned success by following trends. She started out in the late Nineties as a part of a dance-pop girl group Twist, before embarking on a solo career with her 2003 self-titled album, best known for the song ""En El 2000"" and its lyrics referencing Ricky Martin and Gael GarcÃ_a Bernal. After a solid run of indie pop albums (including 2009's masterful Hu Hu Hu), Lafourcade began working with traditional styles, becoming a critical and commercial powerhouse in the process.Mujer Divina, her 2012 album of AgustÃ_n Lara covers, earned her two Latin Grammy awards. She followed that up with Hasta la RaÃ_z, an eclectic collection of originals about heartbreak and romance that earned her an O.G. Grammy in addition to five Latin Grammys. This year, she released Musas Vol. I, a collection of traditional Latin American songs recorded with two veteran Mexican guitarists known as Los Macorinos. The album recently earned her a Latin Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, and her rousing performance of ""TÃº SÃ_ Sabes Quererme"" was one of the highlights of this year's telecast. Recently, Lafourcade performed the theme song to Pixar's Coco, reuniting her (sort of) with Gael GarcÃ_a Bernal. In the lead-up to the release of Musas Vol. II, slated for February 9th â€“ and accompanying world tour â€“ Rolling Stone caught up with Lafourcade to discuss her musical evolution and career.What is the difference between Musas Vol. I and II? I took many more risks with Vol. II. For example, there is a very traditional Mexican song called ""La Llorona"" on Vol. II that we decided to record only with the Macorinos' guitars. It's almost seven minutes of only two guitars and vocals. It's something I had never done before. That very naked way of interpreting music to me was a real challenge. Once you hear them both together, you can understand the whole universe of what we were doing â€“ you can feel the spirit of the muses.Do you have a favorite song from Vol II?Many of them. ""Tus Ojitos"" is an incredible and romantic Peruvian waltz; I tried to make it appear that the heart is singing. ""La Llorona"" is a very Mexican song with many meanings across time. And, of course, ""Danza de Gardenias,"" the song that I wrote, is very special for me â€“ it is the first time that I've performed that kind of music. That song also marks my first opportunity to work with the wit of producer Kiko Campos. I learned so much from him and from the musicians during the performance of that song.What's the biggest difference in your career between now and where you were a decade ago?There are many differences. All these years I have been adjusting constantly. I feel more comfortable with my own voice, my music and my style. I feel like I've been adjusting my own universe all of these years. Now I know what I want to sing and what I want to give to my audience. I've been going through this research of the folklore from my country, all of the classic songwriters and composers. I've also performed many collaborations and duets, which have given me the chance to really build my artistry. For example, through working with Los Macorinos, I've found patience, love, humanity, and different ways to listen and speak while looking for understanding with older people. It was hard at moments, but in the end, it was always loving.You've recorded three albums in the past five years. Two of them have been interpretations of older, traditional songs. Do you feel more comfortable adapting old Mexican pop and folk songs than you did when you were focused on contemporary pop music?I feel comfortable doing both. For example, there was a personal inspiration for recording Musas. I thought, ""OK, I think this time I want to do something more for me. I want to go to the studio and record with Los Macorinos and I want to explore this music that I love."" But when I'm on tour and thinking about fans coming to our shows, I like to fit in many styles. So I go back to the modern pop songs that I sang in the past and I still really enjoy playing that music. I still love my early songs and I would never be ashamed of performing them.Do you still write contemporary pop songs?I don't really focus on if what I'm writing is pop or not. I just write music and then I try to figure out how to arrange the things that I write. For Musas, I was trying to write songs for Los Macorinos, so I wasn't thinking about a modern pop sound. I don't like making things too complicated when writing songs. I want to write in a very easy language that many people will understand.When you say that, I immediately think about what is perhaps the biggest song that you've worked on, ""Remember Me,"" from the Coco soundtrack. What was your experience working on that song, knowing that it would be heard across the world for people of all ages?I feel very proud and honored to be part of one of the best Pixar movies I've ever seen, especially because that movie and that story are about my beautiful country and its wonderful people. I love that people all over the world are able to see and know about Dia de los Muertos, one of the most incredible traditions we have. It made me very happy to know that my voice and recording would be part of the soundtrack so I just put all my heart and love into making it.What did you think of Coco when you finally saw it?Coco is a really amazing movie. The research was made with so much respect. I enjoyed the movie because I know about what they are talking about. I am really proud to be part of the film. Representing Mexicans with my voice is one of the best experiences that I had in 2017.While we're talking about representing your country, the past decade has seen a wave of Latin American musicians who have had huge success both in Spanish and English-speaking countries. Is it something you've thought about, when you're recording Pixar songs or playing at the Grammys?I have seen that by doing great things, things that you love, things that you put all your heart into, you give a lot of inspiration to others. There are many musicians and artists who have given me that inspiration, even peers like Hello Seahorse! and Carla Morrison.Do you think of yourself as a pioneer?In a way, but I was following Julieta Venegas' path and CafÃ© Tacvba's path. It's like a chain and we are all holding each other through this story, all through music.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,Joe Levy,2017-12-04T18:28:00.000Z,Portugal. The Man: Rock's Surprise Heroes,"portugal the man, portugal the man feel it still, feel it still, mike d, portugal the man interview, portugal the man mike d, john gourley, zach carothers",Rolling Stone,"The first cold night of November in Portland, Oregon, found John Gourley and Zach Carothers of Portugal. The Man in a familiar position: in a maroon Ford E350 van, Carothers driving, Gourley in the back. Nine years ago, after the van they'd been touring in shot its transmission for the fifth time, they bought this one used and have logged 217,000 miles since, enough to crisscross the country better than 77 times. During that time, PTM built themselves up from alt-rockers with a debt to Bowie and Pink Floyd and whatever else was handy to this year's biggest crossover band, with a Top Five single, ""Feel It Still,"" that references everything from Motown to the Black Panthers and ""(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party!)"" Their breakthrough album, Woodstock, took four years to finish, as they scrapped sessions with Mike D of the Beastie Boys, then hit the reset button and came up with the song that would put them over the top in about 45 minutes. Gourley and Carothers' friendship goes back two decades, to high school in Wasilla, Alaska. Gourley is PTM's singer-guitarist; Carothers plays bass. They are the band's center, the two who have been at it for the past 13 years. Right now, they're wrapping up a week at home before heading back on the road. Gourley's days revolve around him and his partner, Zoe Manville (a graphic designer who sings with the band), dropping off and picking up their six-year-old daughter, Frances, at kindergarten. Carothers has been on a short fishing trip, and is returning some gear at his uncle's house. This maroon workhorse is his daily driver when in Portland, and after years of sleeping in a van, a tour bus or a plane, he finds it hard to get some rest if there's no moving ground beneath him. ""I am like, 'Sorry, I got to make myself a box on the floor. Pretend I am in a bunk,'"" he says. ""Nothing stresses me out more than relaxing. It's the work ethic we grew up with â€“ in Alaska if you stop working, you die."" Errand finished, we roll to Pok Pok, a celebrated Thai restaurant. Carothers â€“ who radiates a gentle take-care-of-everyone vibe â€“ has organized a big dinner for King Krule, the U.K. singer-songwriter, and his band, who've been stuck in town with tour bus problems. We're joined inside by Manville and PTM keyboardist Kyle O'Quin, as well as Krule, his band and more friends. Drummer Jason Sechrist, whose wife gave birth to their first baby 12 days ago, is here as well, though guitarist Eric Howk is at a wedding. (A paraplegic since an accident 10 years ago, he grew up with Carothers and Gourley, and has been playing with PTM since 2015.) Food and beer arrive. Then more food. And more beer. On a bigger such night â€“ at an afterparty PTM threw for Arcade Fire in Australia three years ago â€“ the action reached a fever pitch that involved PTM's tour manager proclaiming, ""The Lords of Portland are in town!"" The name stuck; the band and crew now have Lords of Portland tattoos, and the band plays occasional club gigs under the name. ""We thought it was funny to create a gang mentality,"" says Carothers. ""Because Portland is such a pacifist town. We can just take it over."" The Lords of Portland are a beneficent gang, though. Talk turns to a tour a while back that saw the destruction of dressing rooms, though not at the hands of PTM. Gourley remembers seeing the guitarist of one band about to hurl a bottle of red wine at the wall. He offered a word of caution. ""He looks at me and says, 'Rock &amp; roll!' Smashes the bottle against the wall,"" Gourley says. ""And I'm like, 'Someone has to clean that up.'""  The next morning, after a late breakfast, Carothers and Gourley get haircuts. They're leaving in a day for Spain, where they'll play an awards show orgaâ€¨nized by Europe's biggest Spanish-language radio station. At one of Portland's many throwback barber shops, Carothers and Gourleyâ€¨ sit in facing chairs and try not to â€¨look at each other. They've had plenty of practice. Both 36, they've spent half their lives together, give or take a year or two. Carothers was one of the most popular kids in high school, Gourley a painfully shy kid who did a year and a half of home school rather than endure middle-school bullying. They talk about Alaska with a mix of reverence and relief to have left for somewhere less isolated. ""We'd watch Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and we were like, 'What the fuck's a neighborhood?'"" says Carothers. Gourley grew up moving from one remote spot to another, as his father ran construction crews, building hotels for Princess Cruises. ""We lived off the grid, as far away from people as we could be at any time,"" he says. Both of his parents ran the Iditarod, the long-distance dog-sled race, and when they lived on the Cook Inlet, beluga whales would surface off their backyard. ""I was like, 'All right, yeah, I get it â€“ the whales are back again. Can I watch that movie with the crazy sci-fi shit?'"" Sci-fi and horror movies were his thing, and his childhood dream was scriptwriting. ""I was supershy,"" he says; later he uses the phrase ""crippling social anxiety."" Carothers' dad worked for Pepsi. ""I was the city boy because I lived closer to the town of Wasilla,"" he says. ""But I could walk out my back door and it would be two miles before I hit another house."" At 12 he bought a Dead Kennedys ""Too drunk to fuck T-shirt"" (his mom wouldn't let him wear it to school) and started playing guitar, fueled by discovering Nirvana, the Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine. ""All at the same time,"" he says. ""It was like Wizard of Oz â€“ I saw the world in color.""Carothers moved from Wasilla to Monmouth, Oregon, in the early aughts for college, then left school for a screamo band in Portland, recruiting Gourley in 2002. When that band broke up, it formed Portugal. The Man and toured relentlessly (the punctuation mark is an attempt to make the band feel like a bigger entity). Sometimes, live, Gourley would simply stop singing, forcing the band into a jam; he was calmer if everyone else onstage felt the same sense of anxiety he did, and his occasional panic attacks began to subside.They made five albums from 2006 to 2010, making it up as they went along â€“ proggy one moment, bluesy the next, glam-psychedelic the one after that. In 2010, they signed with Atlantic and began recording In the Mountain in the Cloud with producer John Hill, who'd worked with Santigold and M.I.A. The major-label-debut pressure almost destroyed them. Used to making albums in 10 days, they suddenly had too much time, and the songs underwent endless revisions. ""That was the darkest time of our band,"" says Carothers.Mike D remixed ""Modern Jesus"" from 2013's Evil Friends, offering the hip-hop-loving Carothers and Gourley a chance to meet one of their heroes. ""They are music nerds the way I am,"" says Mike D. ""When they started talking about themselves I realized that they were outcast punk-rock skateboard kids from Alaska. I felt a kinship."" He booked Rick Rubin's Shangri-La studio, in Malibu, on the cheap â€“ when Rubin was away or Kanye West didn't have it on lock â€“ and they got to work on PTM's next album, knocking out the basics for five tracks in a week. Sessions were stop-and-start, and as the recording budget dwindled, Mike D offered to let them stay at his house and use his home studio. But the variations on the tracks became endless, and Mike D's emphasis on song construction didn't gel with Gourley. ""I was like, 'John, let's try and get some lyrics done,'"" Mike D says. ""He's like, 'Yeah, I don't really work like that. I kinda like to put the TV on in the background and my stuff happens.'"" In the end, the stuff happening on the TV in the background was the problem. As recording dragged on, the 2016 presidential campaign began going to darker and darker places. Gourley and Carothers thought the songs they had sounded too perfect, they didn't reflect the moment. ""I feel like things need to be a part of the world â€“ that snapshot of what's happening,"" Gourley says. ""That's what I love about hip-hop. I couldn't be happy with something that felt so easy."" On a trip home to Wasilla, Gourley's dad gave them a pep talk: ""What's taking so long? Just grab your instruments, go into a room, write some songs."" He also showed them his ticket from Woodstock, which had turned up at the bottom of a tool kit he'd given a friend. Something clicked, and Gourley decided they'd start with a fresh vision: an album called Woodstock. ""Everybody said, 'That's the fucking stupidest thing I've ever heard,'"" he says. One way or another, it worked. Released in June, Woodstock has tracks from four years of sessions with Mike D, John Hill and Danger Mouse. Its sound is strange and smooth at the same time, a product of the easy flow between the indie-rock and pop worlds that define session work in Los Angeles these days. The band played on hip-hop sessions Hill produced, as well as Hill's tracks for Elle King, and wrote with Ammar Malik (whose credits include Maroon 5's ""Moves Like Jagger""). ""Seeing how a real pop songwriter works â€“ it reminded me of making our first record,"" says Gourley. The version of ""Feel It Still"" that's been streamed more than 200 million times was an accident. Gourley was in the lounge at Hill's studio, messing with a Motown-style bass line. Their friend Asa Taccone from the band Electric Guest was there, and asked to record the bit. They looped the bass line, and Gourley latched on to the melody of one of the oldies he used to sing along to on family trips into town to get groceries, the Marvelettes' ""Please Mr. Postman."" Suddenly, a track he had been trying to nail down for years just clicked, and the basic work was done in less than an hour. The song's politics aren't exactly explicit, but an interactive video links to resistance causes, and the chorus references both 1966, the year the Black Panthers were founded, and 1986, the year ""Fight for Your Right"" came out. (""I did not know that,"" says Mike D, who recorded several early versions of the song. ""Here I was in the studio with him â€“ I did not even get the shout-out."") Goosed by its use in ads for Apple and Vitaminwater, the song's success has been a happy shock. ""It's like there's a nationwide gas leak,"" Carothers says. ""Donald Trump is in the White House, Portugal. The Man is on Top 40 radio. America, are you OK?"" Unlike the Nineties bands they grew up on, they love talking to Top 40 stations. ""I think about all the interviews we heard where the rock band would be on a pop station, shutting down the DJ, just being dicks,"" says Gourley. ""This is so weirdly fun for us."" Gourley has chased his ambition more relentlessly, and successfully, than any rock songwriter in recent years, but he states it modestly: ""I just want to write songs that Frances can be proud of when she grows up.""  Night has fallen on the second cold day of November in Portland, and Gourley wants tocheck in at home before Frances goes to bed. He stops to gas up his car (excepthe's forgotten his wallet), then drops me off. As we say goodbye, he tells me astory about being a kid. He and his dad saw a moose by their house, and his dadsuggested they go after it. He'd never been hunting with his father, and he wasexcited. They came up on the moose, his dad raised his gun, looked over at hisson and asked, ""John, should I get it?"" He did this several times,and every time the answer was yes, with Gourley's sense of anticipation growingand growing. Finally, his dad put his gun down. ""We're not going to getit,"" he said. ""You know why? Because we don't need it."" And withthat Gourley is gone into the night, in search of just the things he needs.Portugal.

93,Kory Grow,2017-11-03T13:54:00.000Z,Gary Clark Jr. on 'Come Together' Cover: 'I Hope Paul and Ringo Dig It',"gary clark jr,gary clark jr interview,gary clark jr come together,come together,come together cover,come together justice league,new gary clark jr,junkie xl,gary clark jr junkie xl,justice league soundtrack",Rolling Stone,"Gary Clark Jr. had never so much as considered covering the Beatles' ""Come Together"" until he was approached to play on a version of it for the Justice League soundtrack. It ended up being the most fun Clark has ever had in the studio. ""I don't know what 'toe-jam football' is, but I'll sing the shit out of it,"" he nonchalantly tells Rolling Stone. ""I printed out the lyrics and I went for it.""The recording is a freewheeling electro-rock crossover that features Clark playing his signature bluesy guitar licks around Junkie XL's stomping, bass-heavy refiguring of the Beatles riff. Fittingly, Clark's vocal performance grooves up slowly, and he commands a wailing guitar solo at the end that's been evolving on the road since he left the recording studio. There's even a six-minute extended version of the tune with more guitar. Clark says he was wholly unaware of Junkie XL, who's best known for his remix of Elvis Presley's ""A Little Less Conversation"" and comic-book move soundtracks, before they met. The producer simply showed Clark some videos of him performing before broaching the subject at hand: playing over what Clark describes as Junkie XL's ""industrial, raw, futuristic-type shit"" in ""Come Together."" ""He said, 'I think you would be the guy to do this thing some sort of justice,'"" Clark recalls. ""Then he said, 'You know that fuzzy guitar shit that you do?' And I was like, 'Yeah.' And he was like, 'Just do that.' Then I put the guitar over my shoulder and just let loose.""""It was like being in a garage band again, just 15-year-old kids making noise,"" Clark adds. ""The last time I felt that I was in a session with Alicia Keys. It was incredible. It just depends on who you work with and what kind of energy they bring. We left, and I was like, 'Man, we got to do this again.'""As for whether or not the two actually will jam together again, Clark says it's up in the air. They want to see how ""Come Together"" does commercially, since the producer is tied up in movie sores and has a tight schedule. In the meantime, Clark has been slowly moving forward with new music. It's been two years since he put out The Story of Sonny Boy Slim, and he's now in the early stages of making a follow-up in a Texas studio. Lately, he's been collaborating with a couple of Austin-based rappers, Zeale and Phranchyse. ""I don't know why he can't just spell 'franchise' like normal people, but we went to school together,"" Clark says with a laugh. ""I make beats from time to time and we just decided to put that together.""Right now, he says it's too soon to tell when the recordings would come out, though, since he's ""just being free and creative and having fun"" at the moment. But Clark adds there's a darkness to the material, considering he's been writing about current events. ""I don't know if I will be addressing Trump directly, but that's something that's happening in life and it's hard not to see it happen,"" he says. ""The things I'm writing and thinking about aren't necessarily meadows and orchards, you know what I mean?""Until he's ready to put that out, though, he says he's enjoying working out a live arrangement of ""Come Together"" on the road. ""I'm still messing up the lyrics,"" he says with a laugh. ""We've been playing it for a few moths, so it's still fresh and very new. I'm sure it will take on some sort of new life when we get comfortable with it. All my songs tend to do that.""Ultimately, he has one goal in mind for the song. ""It's a classic, so I was cautious with it,"" he says. ""I just hope that when Paul and Ringo hear it, they dig it. That's all you can hope for.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,Maura Johnston,2017-12-04T15:26:00.000Z,"Moses Sumney Talks Defying Genres, Romantic Myths on Audacious Debut LP","moses sumney, new artists, aromanticism, mosey sumney songs, solange, SZA, karen o, best new artists of 2017, moses sumney photos, rolling stone new artis",Rolling Stone,"Listen to any playlist of smash hits from the last century and you'll probably hear the word ""love"" within 10 minutes â€“ romance and its pursuit have been popular music's number one topic since the Songs of Solomon were published, if not earlier. But the young singer Moses Sumney's debut album Aromanticism turns that ideal upside down, exploring the pursuit of happiness without a happily-ever-after â€“ examining the whole idea of ""love"" with a critical yet caring eye.""I felt really alienated by mainstream society's vocabulary around what romantic love was, and what it looked like for different people,"" he tells Rolling Stone via phone from Houston. ""I was looking around, like, 'What is it called when you feel this, but you don't feel this, but you kind of feel this â€“ but you don't feel that?'"" Finding out about ""aromanticism"" â€“ the capability to feel love without the desire to have a romantic partner â€“ set off a lightbulb in his head, and created the conceptual core for his first full-length. Aromanticism's flipping of the cultural script is mirrored in the album's category-busting vibrancy. Sumney, a self-taught singer, can squeeze his voice into a whispered falsetto and multiply it into a pleading choir; his songs defy verse-chorus-verse convention while incorporating R&amp;B's grooves and dreampop's hazes, rumbling-stomach drones and robo-funk synths. (Listening on headphones both enhances the musical experience and doubles down on Sumney's idea of being apart from the world.) He embodies the genre-agnostic world of playlists yet he crafted Aromanticism as a seamless work.The album grew out of a period where, Sumney recalls, he ""went into the mountains and shut off my phone and did not have internet [and] was not really communicating with the outside world for days to weeks at a timeâ€_. I was very adamant about not including others in the lyric-writing process or in the melody-writing process."" This approach both reflects the LP's theme of solitude and showcases his undergraduate poetry training; his verses are economical yet not clipped, emotional yet accessible. In September, he wrote a manifesto of sorts on the album's origins: ""Many of the origin stories about the inception of our species establish this blueprint for coexistence â€“ that every body has an equal and opposite body, a destined companion without which we are incomplete,"" he posted to Tumblr. ""Our modern construct of romance still upholds this paradigm; romantic love is the paramount prize of existence. But what if I can't access that prize?"" That forceful statement was meant to work in tandem with the album's softer side. ""I wanted to really explore beauty in language,"" he says. â€œThat was radical for me. But I also wanted to be direct. I wanted to be understood, and I wanted to not let the brain overtake the heart."" Sumney uses poetic imagery to enhance the dreamy feel of songs, like the adrift-in-space ""Plastic"" and cuts right to the chase on ""Make Out in My Car,"" where, amidst string flourishes and depths-plumbing beats, he sings ""I'm not tryin'a go to bed with you/ I just wanna make out in my car"" repeatedly and with building intensity (and, eventually, his own voice in choir). ""Stoicism"" pairs finely wrought, spoken micro-fiction about the complicated love between a mother and son with droning horns. Closing out the album is the sparkling, hopeful ""Self-Help Tape"" which, featuring Sumney's soaring, multi-tracked vocalizations, abandons words almost completely.The six-plus-minute epic ""Quarrel"" takes an even more ambitious approach. Musically, it began as a beat that Sumney made with producer Cam O'bi (Chance the Rapper, SZA) â€“ the goal, he says, was to make ""something that was like a fucked-up Stereolab song."" Over the next year, New York-based jazz harpist Brandee Younger contributed to the track, and Paris Strother of the synth&amp;b revivalists KING added keyboards to its outro â€“ which explodes into a space-funk come-on, then blooms into piano cascades. ""Quarrel"" runs the emotional and musical gamut, echoing the searing pain and self-protecting ambivalence outlined in its lyrics. Restlessness has been a constant for Sumney. Born in California, he lived in Ghana as a child, then returned to the Golden State to attend UCLA.&nbsp; In 2014, he released the EP Mid-City Island, which he followed up with 2016's five-song Lamentations. He's also collaborated with a number of musicians from Los Angeles' varied music scenes; he played and produced the opening track for the official recording of Beck's sheet-music collection Song Reader, sang backing vocals on Solange's A Seat at the Table, and has worked with the likes of Karen O and Sufjan Stevens. ""I'm kind of a floater,"" he says.With Aromanticism, though, Sumney has staked out solid ground; he's released 2017's most creatively audacious debut, a hushed yet steely-eyed agitation against societal and musical expectations. ""I didn't want to make something that was just one thing,"" says Sumney. ""I wanted to be able to honor a lot of different types of music â€“ I didn't explore everything sonically, but I wanted to. I feel glad that I got to do something that was multi-dimensional.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,Brian Hiatt,2018-01-09T15:00:00.000Z,Greta Van Fleet's Misty Mountain Revival,"greta van fleet, greta van fleet interview, greta van fleet ep, greta van fleet covers, greta van fleet rolling stone, greta van fleet led zeppelin, led zeppelin, jimmy page, greta van fleet band",Rolling Stone,"The four members of the Michigan band Greta Van Fleet look, act and sound like they were grown in the lab of some classic-rock-loving mad scientist. How else to explain a group of kids who go around dropping references to Vanilla Fudge's Carmine Appice and Free's Paul Kossoff, who cover Fairport Convention and Howlin' Wolf â€“ and who, by the way, make huge, throwback, blues-riff-riding rock that often sounds preposterously, uncannily close to newly unearthed Led Zeppelin tracks? ""We are like a bunch of old men,"" acknowledges pixieish, curly-headed frontman Josh Kiszka, possessor of a blowtorch of a high tenor, with casual access to notes that Robert Plant misplaced during the Carter administration.The singer, who was starring in high school plays not long ago, is sipping tea on an early-December afternoon in the band's dressing room at New York's Bowery Ballroom, sporting the same college-production-of-Hair look he'll wear onstage tonight for a sold-out show: blouse-y kurta, ankle-high jeans, moccasins, a tribal necklace he believes to be African in origin. (""He's always worn weird shit,"" says Jake Kiszka, the band's longhaired, justifiably self-assured guitarist, who's more of a T-shirt-and-skinny-jeans guy.)There was (probably) no laboratory involved, but three of the members are family: Josh and Jake are 21-year-old twins, while bassist-keyboardist Sam Kiszka is their 18-year-old brother â€“ in their cover-band days, they had him playing biker bars at age 12. As it turns out, their dad is a chemist with a serious record collection and a harmonica-playing habit, and their mom is a former science teacher (their grandpa, meanwhile, is in the Polka Hall of Fame). The fourth member is strong-footed drummer Danny Wagner, 18, one of the few other kids in their tiny town of Frankenmuth who shared his friends' prodigious musical gifts and time-warped sensibilities â€“ their classmates didn't even know what to call the odd music they liked, except ""old."" As incongruous as the whole Greta Van Fleet experience may be, it's catching on, and quickly. Veteran exec Jason Flom â€“ who helped launch Paramore, Lorde and Kid Rock â€“ snatched them up for a major-label deal. The first song they ever wrote, ""Highway Tune,"" hit Number One on mainstream rock radio, or at least what's left of it. And their flat-out incredible live shows are attracting more and more fans close to their own age â€“ something that first seemed possible back when they played their high school's homecoming dance, and the kids freaked out.As Josh and Sam tell it, Greta Van Fleet landed on their Seventies-rock sound by tracing the same blues-and-soul influences that shaped older bands, rather than through direct imitation â€“ although even their earliest gigs were heavy on Cream covers, plus the occasional Bad Company tune. As a kid, Sam remembers listening to ""all the Kings â€“ B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King â€“ and then, like, Buddy Guy."" ""I didn't know who fucking Led Zeppelin was until I was in high school,"" Josh adds. The story goes that his Plant-ian shriek simply came out in practice one day as he struggled to be heard over the band. ""We stopped,"" recalls Jake, ""and were like, 'Whatever you just did, keep doing that, 'cause it sounds badass.'â€‰""Jake does cop to careful scrutiny of Jimmy Page â€“ among many other guitarists, including Pete Townshend. ""I went through a year of really intensely studying what Page did,"" says Jake, ""to the point where I knew how he thought.""They're not altogether averse to newer music, citing, among other acts, Fleet Foxes, Rival Sons, the Shins and especially the Black Keys, whose 2012 Rolling Stone cover decorated their garage rehearsal space for years. ""Our dad brought the Magic Potion album home, and we're like, 'Wow, this is contemporary music?'â€‰"" says Sam, whose long hair and boyish features make him look like a lost Hanson brother â€“ albeit one who's a phenomenally melodic bass player, when he's not switching to organ and handling the low end via foot pedals, Ã  la Ray Manzarek. But unlike the Keys, none of Greta Van Fleet's members are hip-hop fans, and they can truly sound decades older than their years when they talk about current music. ""People are doing it for the wrong reasons,"" says Sam. ""They are not doing it to change the world. They are doing it to make money.""Before Greta Van Fleet â€“ who are named after a local woman named Gretna Van Fleet â€“ can change the world, they have to finish their first album. It'll follow their eight-song EP, From the Fires, which had six originals (there's also an excellent cover of Fairport's ""Meet on the Ledge"" â€“ and an ill-conceived version of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come""). The LP will be all-new songs, most already written, with time carved out in early 2018 to record.In the meantime, they're having fun. Jake takes apreshow swig from a bottle of Jack Daniel's each night â€“ ""a rock &amp;roll ritual,"" he calls it. But they swear that they're going to keep itall in check. ""Everything that you hear about the rock &amp; rolllifestyle is true,"" says Josh, wide-eyed. ""All of those wild, absurdthings that you would like to romanticize about are very honest truth. Theamount of excess always around. The amount of women that always want to hangout. It really is all there. It's tempting, and it's crazy stuff."" He smiles.""But we don't seem to have too much interest."" He almost sells theline, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,Andy Greene,2018-02-08T14:11:39.459Z,"Rich Robinson Talks Magpie Salute LP, Rules Out Black Crowes Reunion","Black Crowes, Black Crowes Rich Robinson, Black Crowes Chris Robinson",Rolling Stone,"In January 2017, Rich Robinson decided to resurrect the music of the&nbsp;Black Crowes during a four-night stand at New York's Gramercy Theater with a little help from his ex-bandmates Marc Ford and Sven Pipien. They called the group (which also features singer John Hogg and members of Robinson's solo band) the Magpie Salute. Much to their shock, the shows sold out within minutes and before they knew it over 75 gigs were booked all over America and Europe. ""We really became a band on that tour,"" says Robinson. ""That's what it takes, getting out there and touring and playing to where everyone can start to read each other's minds. We became a single unit.""Their set list consisted largely of Black Crowes songs and Rich Robinson solo tunes in addition to classic-rock covers like Rod Stewart's ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" and Elton John's ""My Father's Gun,"" but during downtime between shows they began working on original tunes. ""We wrote some during soundcheck and others in the back of the bus,"" says Robinson. ""Some songs I just wrote at home on my acoustic guitar."" They've demoed all of the tunes and plan on cutting them in Nashville later this month for the Magpie Salute's debut album. Robinson will produce the sessions himself. ""Normally it's just me and our drummer Joe [Magistro] when I make records,"" he says. ""So it's cool to have Sven and this whole band in there recording us live as a band in the live room. We're all really excited."" There's no exact timeline for finishing the album or getting it into stores, but Rich thinks they should have a great deal of it done after just about six weeks in the studio. They'll support it later this year with another tour. ""I see this group as my main outlet now,"" says Robinson. ""I share such a strong musical connection with these people. Marc Ford and I have this thing and it's something you can't put your finger on and understand, but he and I just go to these places when we play together. The older I get, the more I realize how important that is.""Rich's estranged brother/ex-bandmate Chris Robinson referred to the Magpie Salute as a ""Black Crowes tribute band"" during an interview on The Howard Stern Show last year, but weeks ago he announced that his new project, As the Crow Flies, would also be playing the group's old material on a tour this year. ""He has a tendency to run his mouth,"" says Rich. ""And actions speak louder than words. So now he's in a Black Crowes tribute band."" When the group split up in 2015, Rich said in a press release that the final straw came when Chris wanted to put founding drummer Steve Gorman on salary and change the group's profit-sharing agreement. ""He pretends to be this peace-loving hippie that doesn't care about money,"" says Rich, ""while trying to take everyone's money.""Rich is also irritated with the way that Chris has described the Black Crowes' songwriting process. ""For a long time he's tried to diminish what I've done in the band,"" he says. ""Chris wrote the lyrics and I wrote all of the music and arranged the songs. He's kind of hinted that that wasn't the case and him saying I'm in a Black Crowes tribute band is him trying to diminish the fact that those are my songs and I'm out there playing my songs with the guys that actually played on those records. That being said, I wish Chris well. Ultimately, I love him. He's incredibly talented and a great singer. I wish him well. I'm really more excited about what I'm doing now and moving forward and making this great record and getting out there just exploring music with the people that I admire and want to play with.""All of this means a Black Crowes reunion remains nothing but a remote possibility. ""I kind of feel like it's in the Kinks realm where it's just done,"" says Rich. ""I'm really happy not to play with him. I don't think it's healthy for anyone to be around that. If he's truly happy playing CRB [Chris Robinson Brotherhood] songs and that it's silly to play Black Crowes songs until he's ready to do it, then it's great. So be it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,Paula Mejia,2017-11-20T15:49:01.759Z,Oh Sees' John Dwyer on What Drives His Endless DIY Quest,"oh sees, thee oh sees, john dwyer, john dwyer interview, oh sees interview, castle face, coachwhips, oh sees interview, brigid dawson",Rolling Stone,"It's a late August afternoon, and John Dwyer is sitting in his Los Angeles backyard, sipping an iced coffee. His beagle, Buddy, zips around the bramble and the sound of a Robert Fripp record trickles out from inside the house, which doubles as Dwyer's studio. It's a rare moment of downtime for the heavily tattooed frontman of California psychedelic rock group Oh Sees (formerly known as Thee Oh Sees, and sometimes as OCS), a man who has spent the past two decades in fanatical service to his DIY creative muse.&nbsp;Dwyer is never not on: Within the first 10 minutes of his conversation with Rolling Stone, he's touched on tattooing his grandparents' names on his chest, pasta that resembles little ears, and how you can see the namesake of his neighborhood, Eagle Rock, from his porch.Dwyer just wrapped a European tour, and he's already gearing up for the next leg. ""I bought 500 white T-shirts and yesterday all day long I smoked weed, stood in my living room with a big setup, watching Seinfeld all day, just twisting shirts to do 500 tie-dyes, which I'm going to do today,"" the 43-year-old says. He turns down an offer of assistance. ""Oh no, no, that's OK. This is, like, my zen thing that I have to do alone. But I appreciate it. I got 10 days to do 500 shirts and the first step is done, and then I have to make 200 posters which I still kind of need to draw up. But I think I can do it. I like working.""That's one way of putting it. Dwyer recently marked his 20th OCS release â€“ not counting his many side projects and other bands â€“ with Memory of a Cut Off Head. It's a beautiful and unusual record, even for him, hewing closer to reflective chamber pop than the manic, brain-frying work Dwyer is best known for, and it marks the welcome return of longtime collaborator Brigid Dawson on vocals and keyboards. Like any Dwyer product, it's just one piece of a large puzzle that includes his label, Castle Face Records, his solo project Damaged Bug and his obsessive devotion to touring. Originally from Providence, Rhode Island, Dwyer first got into music via skating culture. Yet the emotional aspect of his art stemmed from a lifetime of playing a certain role-playing game. ""Dungeons and Dragons was a huge part of my childhood, even before I got into smoking weed,"" he says, in reference to the fact that the album he released back in August is named Orc. ""It was the first taste I had of imagination-based stuff. I still get immense enjoyment out of writing and playing live, because it's like that magical dopamine kick of creating from nothing."" Exposure to acts including the Cramps at all-ages joints, and a vibrant warehouse scene that gave birth to the likes of noise-rock heroes Lightning Bolt, also jolted a young Dwyer. At age 20 he picked up a guitar, and shortly after moved to San Francisco. He lived there for 17 years and became instrumental in helping build city's DIY garage-rock culture, a fact that led Ty Segall to once dub him ""the mayor of San Francisco."" Along the way, Dwyer cultivated a reputation for putting on some of the most dynamic, high-energy performances in live music. Onstage, his signature vocal delivery â€“ marked by falsetto howls, gasps and moans â€“ has become a rallying cry for fans (especially in set mainstays ""Dead Energy""&nbsp;and ""Tidal Wave""). In 2006, Dwyer co-founded Castle Face. The label's name came from one fateful night when OCS' original drummer got too stoned from a particularly potent joint and ""his mouth looked like a drawbridge,"" Dwyer explains with a chuckle. Since then, the label has released work by garage- and psych-rock luminaries such as Segall and Australian rockers King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.&nbsp;Dwyer seems indifferent to his reputation as a scene godfather. But he does allow that he's gotten better at recording himself, and that over the years his band has become more collaborative. ""Maybe â€“ I'm sure [the band] would disagree with this â€“ I'm more easygoing than I used to be,"" he says with a laugh.&nbsp;The secret to his success might be the fact that he isn't trying to escape his DIY milieu. Oh Sees tend to play the same venues, ones they like, when making the rounds on tour (with the exception of rare one-offs â€“ over the summer, they played a wedding in southern Italy). Just staying busy is enough. ""It seems like the whole world is in a tumultuous vibe, not just with politics but psychically,"" Dwyer says. ""The only way you can try and deal with it, I think, is to make good work and be a good person.""That's why I use the work as my system of getting through everything.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,Steve Knopper,2018-01-31T15:31:00.000Z,Flashback: Michael Jackson Reclaims His Pop Throne at Super Bowl XXVII,michael jackson super bowl,Rolling Stone,"The halftime show for Super Bowl XXVI, in 1992, was legendarily awful â€“ and not just because of the grotesque, striped sweater Olympic figure skater Brian Boitano wore while declaring, with Dorothy Hamill at his side, ""It's winter magic!"" Kids in MC Hammer pants rapped about Frosty the Snowman; a dude on stilts was inexplicably given seven of television's most valuable seconds to wave to the camera. You could practically hear viewers changing channels to Fox' In Living Color halftime special, which beat CBS' official halftime show in the ratings. Something had to be done. Something big.Michael Jackson big.By 1993, MJ's brand of dance music was slipping out of pop culture, as grunge, alternative rock and hip-hop were ascending. The King of Pop was halfway through the Dangerous tour, playing stadiums around the world, but he was 10 years removed from Thriller and needed a pop-culture revival. He agreed to an interview with Oprah Winfrey â€“ still one of Oprah's highest-rated shows ever â€“ and said yes when the NFL asked him to play the 1993 halftime show at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.He had conditions, of course. He wanted to do his newish ballad ""Heal the World"" for the entirety of the 12-minute performance. He wanted 3,500 ""volunteer fans"" to surround the stage, providing an MJ-in-concert experience rather than a bathroom break for rich, beer-drinking football fans in the stadium. And he wanted Don Mischer, the show's producer, to sit in the production truck, directing the performance in real time, even though NBC, the Super Bowl's new network, had its own people and didn't appreciate the meddling.""Michael wasn't too aware of the Super Bowl. He wasn't too aware of how big this was,"" recalls Arlen Kantarian, the show's executive producer. ""He just said, 'Why don't we call it the Thriller Bowl?'""Jackson did not win every argument. The Super Bowl was still the Super Bowl. Producers talked him into performing a medley of his hits â€“ ""Billie Jean,"" ""We Are the World"" and the newish ""Jam"" and ""Black or White"" â€“ in addition to an elaborate show-closing version of ""Heal the World."" But they agreed to let thousands of children file up the steps and onto the stage during the finale, and they agreed to let Mischer co-produce the halftime show in the booth along with NBC's longtime game producer. MJ brought his own band and dancers to perform on a set that weighed 12 tons and had to be built quickly from 26 separate pieces â€“ without damaging the turf for the second half. Producers arranged for 275 people to do the job in less than six minutes.A few days before the game, Jackson and crew had rehearsed in a tent outside the Rose Bowl. ""We all knew, just by reading, about how Michael is a perfectionist,"" Kantarian says. ""But to see how he repeated the same choreography, 12, 14, 16 times, was just incredible."" Jackson's choreographer, Vince Paterson, tried to convince him to try new moves for the show, but MJ didn't want to complicate things. ""That was one of the little points of contention between us for that project,"" Paterson recalls. ""I kept saying, 'But Michael, we've already done this,' and he kept saying, 'But everybody will love it!'""When MJ arrived on stage, he was jittery. ""That's the only time I ever felt that Michael was nervous â€“ because that's a hell of a lot of pressure. If something goes wrong, that's forever,"" says Jennifer Batten, his lead guitarist at the time. ""He was a little scatterbrained."" Jackson had been opening shows on the Dangerous tour by launching eight feet into the air, from a machine known as the toaster, then holding a pose in his navy-and-gold military jacket and sunglasses as the crowd roared. ""He said, 'Don't queue the music to start, or anything else, until I break my wrist. I'm gonna feel it. I'm gonna feel it,'"" Mischer recalls. ""So he bops out of the toaster, and 20 seconds go by. Thirty seconds go by. It is now feeling like an eternity. His fans are screaming, but he just doesn't give me the cue. ... It got down to me saying, 'Come on, Michael! Jesus Christ!' It finally came down to a minute and 35 seconds â€“ that's like $15 million worth of advertising time.""Everything went right â€“ even ""Heal the World,"" one of Jackson's most mawkish songs, justified its extended performance with an elaborate stunt, in which the entire crowd turned over cards to reveal giant cartoons of children holding hands. With MJ, the Super Bowl graduated from what Kantarian calls ""a college marching band or Up with People"" to big-time pop stars from BeyoncÃ© to Prince and Bruce Springsteen. And it was one of the final times Jackson was fully in command of his own image and career â€“ months later, a child would accuse him of molestation, charges Jackson fought, then settled. ""He was a gentle, quiet man,"" Mischer says. ""But when he stepped onstage, he became a general.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,Jonah Weiner,2017-11-17T14:48:00.000Z,Post Malone: Confessions of a Hip-Hop Rock Star,"post malone, post malone interview, post malone rolling stone, rockstar, post malone rockstar, post malone charlamagne tha god, post malone bieber, justin bieber, post malone girlfriend, post malone guns",Rolling Stone,"Last night, the new Call of Duty came out, and Post Malone was so stoked about it that he parked himself in front of his Xbox until 6 a.m. Right now it's 4 p.m. and he's back at it. It's a sunny Friday in the affluent L.A. suburb of Tarzana, but the shades are drawn in Malone's den to block the light â€“ his wall-size projecting screen is particularly susceptible, he says, to glare.Malone is only 22, but he's one of the most popular musicians in the country. His single ""Rockstar"" has been America's Number One hit for five weeks and counting. The track, which features 21 Savage, celebrates a raw brand of hedonism â€“ ""I've been fucking ho's and popping pillies, man/I feel just like a rock star-ar-ar"" â€“ that smudges into fatalism. The music is sparse and chilly; the two actual rock stars Malone likens himself to in the lyrics, Bon Scott and Jim Morrison, both died young.Markers of Malone's success are everywhere in the house. In the living room, platinum plaques commemorating previous releases lay stacked on his white marble floor opposite a pool table with shiny chrome legs. It is the second-most-outrageous thing in sight, after the enormous framed portrait of Malone as a centaur holding an American flag amid a landscape strewn with crushed beer cans.Malone is sitting on a white leather couch, barefoot in black Italian fashion sweatpants, wearing an oversize T-shirt with food stains on it. He's fresh off a two-month tour he describes as ""exhausting, but it's always cool to meet fans."" He adds, ""On Halloween, they came dressed up like me, which is easy: Just look homeless.""Behind him, in the kitchen, members of Malone's entourage mill about. There's an almost-empty 1.75-liter jug of Grey Goose, and some lavender-scented Spic and Span, on hand because Malone's French bulldog, Branson, keeps ""pissing and jizzing"" all over the floor. ""He's getting his balls cut off next week,"" Malone says, ruffling Branson's forehead. ""You better jizz it up till then, because your days are numbered.""Also on the counter is the November issue of Guns &amp; Ammo, which catches my eye because there's been talk of visiting a gun range later on â€“ something Malone does often. ""I love shooting,"" he says. ""The feeling is pure â€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰inebriation. It's like hitting a punching bag to let off steam.""Turns out that today he just wants to stay in, ""but I can show you what I got here if you want,"" he says, at which point he leads me to a walk-in closet, which is where I learn that Malone owns a disconcerting amount of weaponry. ""This is an M14 â€“ the gun Navy SEALs use,"" he says, placing a chunky rifle in my hands. He takes it back, hands over a Walther PPK â€“ ""James Bond's gun"" â€“ with decorative engraving down the barrel. Next up are a .44 Desert Eagle hand cannon and an M1911 pistol, then two gold-plated Glocks â€“ ""I'd never actually shoot these."" Finally, there's his Cobalt AR-15, an assault rifle, specially modified to pass California regulations, that he's particularly proud of. ""Looks like something out of Halo, right?""He ducks into a bathroom to ash the cigarette he's smoking, then makes for his master bedroom, which he shares with his longtime girlfriend, Ashlen. On the floor beside their bed is a pump-action Mossberg shotgun: ""Great for home defense."" He reaches behind a pillow, fishes out an FN Five-Seven pistol fitted with a laser sight and â€“ to better disorient any home invaders, he explains â€“ a strobe light. He goes behind another pillow, pulls out a Glock 19. ""This is for Ashlen. It's supereasy to use.""I say ""holy shit"" a lot, and ask several variations on a question: Why does he have all these guns? ""They're fun, they're practical, and bad shit happens,"" he says. ""If you hurt me, I'm gonna hurt you back."" Has anyone made threats against him? He shakes his head. ""Just being in the public eye. I have a lot of valuable shit. I have a lot of friends I wanna protect.""Also: ""The world is going to shit. They're taking away a lot of our rights. We have a shitty thing going on in the White House â€“ I don't like Trump. But I don't think it's just him. Something's coming.""""The world is going to shit. They're taking away a lot of our rights.""It is mere weeks after America's worst mass shooting in modern history â€“ a train of thought he anticipates: ""A lot of people are sensitive about it these days, but it's an American right to own a gun. It kinda sucks that now we have to live in fear of going out to a concert, but there'll always be bad people, and if bad people want firearms, they'll get 'em no matter what.""I wasn't expecting to debate gun control with Post Malone, but I tell him that, when I learned that the Las Vegas shooter used a so-called ""bump stock"" to effectively turn his rifle fully automatic, I couldn't understand why anyone would need a weapon like that. Malone contemplates this. ""I don't know. ... Get tighter groupings, show off your aim to your buddies at target practice?"" He ruminates a bit more, then shrugs and smiles. ""I don't know, man. I don't have all the answers â€“ I'm just trying to get my money and get out.""&nbsp;Malone has cultivated a hard-partying image, but there's been a dark streak to his music since his 2015 single ""White Iverson,"" which sounds mournful even though it's ostensibly about chasing success. When I mention this downbeat vibe, he nods. ""I've always had a loneliness. I've always been anxious."" He taps his skull and chuckles. ""Big brain. Lot of thoughts.""Even sitting atop the pop charts, he says, ""It's easy to feel numb."" Not that he doesn't enjoy himself now and then. When ""Rockstar"" first went to Number One, he says, he celebrated with a blowout meal with Ashlen at Olive Garden: ""I love Olive Garden."" He has an extravagant loafer collection, including $1,700 Louboutins with embroidered crests that say ""Loubi for ever"" in gold. ""Those are super-ignorant,"" he says, beaming.Out in the driveway, there's a shiny white Rolls-Royce Wraith. ""You wanna go for a ride?"" He pads outside, still barefoot, turns on the ignition. He presses a button and hundreds of tiny fiber-optic lights in the ceiling flash on, like we're in a mobile planetarium. ""I'm giving you the hot-chick treatment,"" he says of the light show. He bursts down his block and hangs a hard right. ""This is not a good message, but this car is a great drunk-driver,"" he notes. ""It's got human detection."" He sticks his foot outside the driver's side window, lets the breeze blow through his toes.He was born Austin Post in Syracuse, New York. When he was nine, his dad got a job managing concessions for the Dallas Cowboys, and they moved to Texas. As a kid, Austin turned a Guitar Hero habit into an actual guitar-playing hobby. His tastes were all over the map. In high school, he made a hip-hop mixtape called Young and After Them Riches, and played ""in a metal band and in an indie band."" He loves Hank Williams and A$AP Ferg, Biohazard and Father John Misty. His talent is broad: You can find videos of him covering Bob Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"" with convincing tenderness, Rage Against the Machine's ""Killing in the Name"" with convincing ferocity.Classmates of Malone's once voted him ""Most Likely to Become Famous,"" but this testified less to his popularity than his eccentricity. For an art class, he made a jokey synth-pop track under the pseudonym Leon DeChino, complete with a video in which he danced in booty shorts and a leopard-print head scarf. At one point he saved up $800 from his job at a place called Chicken Express and blew it on a pair of Versace loafers: ""I was weird.""At his home, the doorbell rings and Malone's Dallas buddy Jason Probst walks in. A few years ago, Probst became an unlikely online micro-celebrity by streaming video of himself and friends playing Minecraft while cracking jokes. In 2014, Probst moved west, renting a house in Encino with some other Minecraft players, and Malone left Dallas to tag along, ""chilling and freeloading,"" he says, hoping that proximity to the music industry might lead to a big break. ""I had to make it work,"" Malone says. ""It was that or Chicken Express.""Within a year, he'd talked his way into free time at a studio, where he met the producer FKi 1st, who liked Malone enough to work on some tracks with him. One was ""White Iverson,"" which Malone put on SoundCloud, where it took off â€“ Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller tweeted endorsements, and Malone soon signed a major-label deal. Six more platinum-certified singles followed. Before long, Kanye West invited Malone to join him and Rick Rubin in the studio, and Justin Bieber picked him as an opening act and sang on his debut, 2016's Stoney.When I ask Malone about Bieber, he calls him ""a fucking awesome, great dude"" and ""a genuine friend."" He adds, ""He's gotten super-religious recently. Real culty."" He's referring to Hillsong, a megachurch that Bieber belongs to. ""It's not culty!"" Ashlen interjects. ""It's a total cult,"" Malone continues. ""He's already given them, like, $10 million. Those are the worst kinds of people. I used to be super-religious. I believed in God. But now I see through it. It's nice to support something you believe in, I guess, but people are spending so much money, and God doesn't care that your church has a fucking gold roof."" I ask if he's shared these thoughts with Bieber. ""We don't talk about this stuff,"" he says. (A source close to Bieber denies that he's given $10 million.)Malone believes that ""genre is stupid,"" so to him there's no contradiction in making a song with Bieber one moment, 21 Savage the next. But some border crossings are more fraught than others, and as a white man who's become hugely successful in a black art form, he's aware of his status as an outsider. He's had to apologize for an old Vine in which he jokingly used the word ""nigga""; more generally, he's had to answer to skeptics. The most prominent such encounter came in 2015, when the radio host Charlamagne tha God took Malone to task, asking him, among other things, what he was doing to support Black Lives Matter. Malone's answer, he admits, was insufficient: ""I guess what I can do to help Black Lives Matter is keep making music. ... I don't know,"" he replied. Looking back, Malone tells me, ""I wish I'd said, 'What are you doing for Black Lives Matter?' Some sassy shit to shut him up. Like, maybe my music's not the best, but I know I'm not a bad person, so you're just being a hater.""Malone shakes his head. ""He's not a good person. He hates me because I'm white and I'm different. But we're still rocking and we're still successful, and he can't stop it."" (Reached for a response, Charlamagne mentions his involvement with various social-justice organizations, and says, ""I don't not like people because they're white â€“ I just didn't like him because at the time I thought he was wack,"" adding that he loves ""Rockstar"" and encourages Malone to ""keep growing, keep winning"" and ""give back to the black community in some form."")I tell Malone that, to my ear, Charlamagne was raising the issues, however confrontationally, of white allyship and cultural appropriation. Malone nods but says that, in his view, he's been the target of so-called reverse racism. ""People are gonna hate you for what they're not gonna understand you for,"" he says. He notes that he supports NFL players who kneel during the anthem. ""It's all about pushing for equality â€“ in both directions,"" he says. ""Especially with the power of music, we can push past the world's flaws and make it a more beautiful place.""&nbsp;A few hours later, the sun has set, and Malone has switched from Call of Duty to Ghost Recon to the wrestling game WWE2K18. Besides gaming and gun ranges, Malone binges TV shows like Power and Designated Survivor. When I ask if he pays attention to the news, he says, ""I'm more into alternate news. Shit not a lot of people read, like conspiracy shit. There's crazy shit that goes on that we can't explain. Chemtrails and shit."" I ask if his interest in conspiracies is ironic or real. ""It's real,"" he says. ""Like, they have a gun that gives you a heart attack, and they can't tell the difference.""It's after 8 p.m. Probst and some of the other guys announce that they're headed out to see the new Thor. Malone sticks to his couch. He's enjoying the downtime, he says. When he hasn't been touring, he's been working on his second album. It's nearly finished and is set to feature collaborations with Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla $ign, John Mayer and Tommy Lee. ""I'm trying to push the genre,"" he says.He has no home studio here, but there will be one, he vows, in his next house: a 13,000-square-foot home in northern Utah that he's about to buy for ""like, $3 million."" Set on nearly seven acres, it will serve as both a party palace for his homeys â€“ ""I'm gonna put in, like, 30 bunk beds"" â€“ and a secluded compound for him and Ashlen to hunker down at, playing Xbox together, riding motorbikes, firing off guns that no one else will be able to hear.""It's free country out there,"" Malone says. ""Like, you can buy suppressors in Utah. You can do open-carry. Walk into the grocery store with a handgun on your hip. Cowboy shit."" He grins. ""I can't wait.""Update: Carl Lentz of Hillsong NYC responds: I put no stock in comments made by people who know absolutely nothing about the subject they are speaking on. I do not know Post Malone and I have no idea why he would say reckless things about our church, which he has never visited. Justin has not given our church 10 million dollars and we do not have gold ceilings. We do not even own a church building. So that gives you a little insight about how serious you can take his observations about anything to do with us. With that said, Iâ€™m still a Post Malone fan; he is a very gifted artist and I wish him nothing but the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,Andy Greene,2018-02-15T21:44:00.000Z,Journey's Jonathan Cain Talks Band Feud: 'Let's Hit Reset',"Jonathan Cain, Jonathan Cain interview, Jonathan Cain book, Journey feud",Rolling Stone,"Just a few months after they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year, Journey&nbsp;went into complete meltdown mode. The trouble began near the end of their summer tour when guitarist Neal Schon began unloading on keyboardist Jonathan Cain via Twitter and a series of interviews. He was furious that Cain took members of the group to the White House and posed for photos with Donald Trump (Cain's wife, Paula White, is the president's spiritual advisor). He was also upset that Cain, in his view, minimized his contributions to key songs like ""Don't Stop Believin'"" and that he was using the band's platform to share his born-again Christian views with the fan base. ""I've stated how I felt about mixing religion and politics and how our music is not of one religion â€“ Democratic or Republican,"" Schon wrote on Instagram. ""This is and has been an issue with myself Mr. Cain and his now wife, since he married. I've had to fight this whole time to protect the brand I built with Steve Perry, way before Gregg [Rolie] and I picked Cain to replace himself when he wanted to retire from the road back then. Well frankly, I'm tired of having to defend all by my self. [Journey bassist] Ross [Valory] is no help.""For weeks on end, Schon slammed Cain and Journey's management via the Internet. It was hard to imagine how that group could continue in the light of such a nasty public spat, and in December, when Schon announced a special charity show with former members of the group, it seemed like he was looking for an exit strategy. But last month, Journey announced a co-headlining tour with Def Leppard that will keep them on the road for much of the summer without any lineup changes. Jonathan Cain said very little about the Schon feud while it was raging, but when he came into the Rolling Stone office to chat about his upcoming memoir Don't Stop Believin' (much more on that closer to its May 1st release date), we asked him about the whole situation. What's the status of your relationship with Neal? Are you on speaking terms?At this point, I'll see him at rehearsals for the tour. That's the way we always operate. I move forward. I don't live in the Bay Area anymore. I have a life with Paula in Florida. He's got a life with [his wife] Michaele  in San Rafael. We meet when we get on the road.In your estimation, what caused him to get so angry with you?You'd have to ask him. I can't speak for him. It was just something that happened. We've had a tremendous relationship for 38 years. Any relationship that goes on that long, there's bound to be bumps in the road. But I think the band and our fans are bigger than all of this stuff. When you read my book, you'll see the mountains and the struggles that we had to overcome together. There were insurmountable situations where we were like, ""How are we going to get out of this one?"" Neal and I brought this thing, along with the rest of the guys, back to where it belonged. I'll always be grateful for that. We're brothers. I'm proud of that.He says that, among other things, he's frustrated that you don't want to make a new Journey album. Is that right?That's not necessarily true. ... I think there's timing for everything. I just felt like the last couple of years wasn't the time for new music. There has to be a time where it feels right, not only for the marketplace, but for us as a band. It's expensive to go into the studio. I went through a divorce. The last thing I needed was to go spend a bunch of money. I'm trying to take care of my life and get on with it. So, when the time is right, yeah. But I mean, we have enough music. The Rolling Stones haven't made a new album in years. I watched them and thought, ""Well, they don't make new music."" The business has changed.Do you think there's an audience for new Journey songs?It's small [makes a tiny circle with his finger and thumb] I've certainly been writing. I've got some killer new ideas, so maybe it'll happen. I'm looking forward. If it's going to happen, we have to all come together. And it has to feel like the right time.&nbsp;Is it hard to be on the road with someone that's bashing you on Twitter day after day?Again, it's not hard. It's something that you tolerate. It's kind of like if you have a fight with your wife. You live in the same house. You have to weather it and overcome it. For the fans, the music is all that matters. We all have our private life and then we have Journey. You go through these things and you gotta get out the steam. Everybody has to vent. Then it's like, ""OK, you said what you said. You said how you feel. Let's move on."" That's how I feel. Let's hit reset and make great music.He was particularly upset about the White House visit. What was your read on that?For me, it was a historical chance to go and it wasn't political. I'm a history buff and was dying to see where all this history took place. I know Arnel [Pineda] wanted to meet the Filipino lady [Cristeta Comerford] that has worked as a chef there for 20-something years. And Neal and I weren't on speaking terms during that time. He was bashing me, so I didn't think he would want to come. That's all.I guess he saw the whole band there and ...It wasn't really a band sort of thing. We're friends with Sarah Huckabee from before the presidential thing. It was just an offer to take a tour. It wasn't an endorsement. Not at all. And Ross decided to come and see the building that Eisenhower bowled in. I was like, ""A bowling alley? How cool!"" We got to see the loft where they make the cookies. The kitchen was so tiny. We saw all the little nooks and crannies and were like, ""Oh, my gosh, this is amazing.""Historically, it felt good to visit. But come to me. Don't go to the fans about it. If you had a problem with it, talk to me. I never heard from him. Are you anxious to sit down with him and hash things out before the tour?Yeah, sure. Sure.Do you think that's going to happen?Yeah. It will. When people read the book, they will see the kind of brotherhood that Neal and I forged. I think that's unbreakable.&nbsp;By the way, which group is going to play last at those Def Leppard shows?We're flip-flopping. In the cities where they are strong, they're closing. The cities we're strong, we're gonna close. It's kind of half and half.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,Sarah  Grant,2018-01-17T17:23:00.000Z,"Heart's Ann Wilson on Sexism in Rock, Why #MeToo Is a 'Power Issue'","ann wilson, heart, nancy wilson, taylor swift, ann wilson sexual assault, ann wilson barracuda, led zeppelin, kanye west, ann wilson barracuda, ",Rolling Stone,"When Taylor Swift boldly educated an attorney about the location of her rear end in a Denver court room last August, Heart's Ann Wilson felt a twinge of compassion. After all, the last time a 27-year-old superstar took on sexism in the music industry was when the singer wrote ""Barracuda"" 40 years ago.&nbsp;""I went through things like 'lizard,' 'snake' â€“ but 'barracuda' just had a wickedness that I thought sounded good. It had rhythm. It just seemed more threatening, more despicable,"" Wilson recalls. The idea for the song was born backstage in 1977 after Heart finished opening for the Kinks in Detroit. A cloying record promoter burst into Ann's dressing room asking where her ""lover"" was, referencing a distressing full-page advertisement their record label planted in Rolling Stone&nbsp;that framed the future Rock and Roll Hall of Fameâ€“inducted sister duo as an incestuous gimmick.&nbsp;""That pissed us off. It went against everything we were trying to initiate, trying to invent â€“ and the fact that our first time in [Rolling Stone] had that lascivious implication,"" Wilson says. ""For [this promoter] to imagine us together in an incestuous lesbian relationship â€“ the sleaze factor really dawned on me in that moment. Those lyrics were written by my true nature, in true rage. I hope that that song will come in handy now when women are thinking about what they want to do and not do.""In a candid interview, Wilson sounded off on sexism in the music industry then and now, the ""bubble of power"" that protects predators, and why she turned to drugs and alcohol at the height of Heart's fame.You've been singing ""Barracuda"" night after night, a song that pre-dates #MeToo by 40 years. Do you feel frustrated that this reckoning has taken decades?&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on in 1977 and it still goes on now. Back then I didn't know why [that was happening] and now I know we were just being cast as cute girls rather than people who had ideas and abilities. Look at someone like Taylor Swift and what she's gone through. She put herself on the line about this guy groping her, and took it all the way to court. There was a lot of eye-rolling about that, but she's making a point. Somebody thinks that they have the right to come around at a meet and greet, reach up her skirt and grab Taylor Swift's ass. And that it was OK. He can go and brag about it in a bar.Did you have experiences like Swift's?Many times. In our early twenties, we'd go into radio stations and they'd say, ""We love your tits."" It was irritating. And if they touched me â€“ that was just the most icky, nauseating feeling ever. But in the Seventies, if I'd have said to my manager, whatever DJ touched my shoulder in the wrong way ... who would get fired? Me.You really thought you'd be fired if you spoke up?Maybe not fired, but passed over; told ""fuck her"" or ""what a bitch."" I heard that tons. People talk about each other in the worst way, especially when you become a product for sale. You're just a thing. ""Is it nice? Is it pretty? Is it amenable? Will people buy it?"" ...&nbsp;Like, ""How wild can you two sisters be together?"" ""They must be in a lesbian incest relationship."" That whole idea of two sisters, young, still nubile, being together in a frame being sexual is a really big diversion. It's a way of taking emphasis off of our music and our message.Do you think, looking back, that those marketing ploys had an impact on Heart's career?I think it made it harder for Heart to break into the mainstream, commercially. And there are lots of shows or theaters that are a little sleazier but really good money, like Playboy Mansionâ€“type things. They would pass on us because we weren't sexy enough. On the other side [laughs], we were approached by Brigham Young University a few times.That's hilarious.&nbsp;And told to make sure nobody was cursing or exposing any nipples [laughs].&nbsp;Does displaying sexuality hurt women more than men in the music industry?It's just not a fair trade. And that's a problem.How is it unfair?Women accept willingly that they have to turn themselves inside out to be good enough â€“ big, plump fish lips, makeup, fuckable. It's really problem for young women in their childbearing years. They need to realize they are more than wombs. They need to realize they are valuable.There are always a few who will come out and go, ""Hey, natural is good! I'm a natural woman. I don't have a landing strip, I let my underarm hair grow!"" There's a few Patti Smiths in every generation. But the bulk is scared to look anything but super-excellent and as they assume the other gender wants them to look. And now there's not a gender; there's a rainbow of people that want to look fantastically sexy as a way of feeling excellent.What about artists who say dressing and acting sexy is empowering?Well, I think young women just coming into their power can mistake their sexual power for their actual power. I think that idea of ""because I'm sexy, I'm a feminist"" is kind of immature. But as long as women think being sexy is what makes them beautiful and powerful ... then it will continue.""The power monster is so fucking hungry and thuggish ... If we're truly going to drain the swamp, Trump can't be exempt.""What's been your reaction to this postâ€“Harvey Weinstein reckoning?&nbsp;I had mixed emotions about it. I'm into truly equality of the genders. I don't harbor any anti-male feeling in my heart. I know that the mothers of feminism, including Gloria [Steinem], never wanted to be anything except 50-50.Can these men be redeemed?I don't know if there is redemption for people like Charlie Rose or Garrison Keillor. An apology helps, but what really matter are deeds.The music industry has been relatively quiet in terms of women coming forward about sexual misconduct allegations.&nbsp;[It's] painfully clear that [the music industry] sort of trades in being inappropriate.So how can the business protect female musicians?[Pauses] We have to redefine that which we haven't even touched. This is not a gender problem. It's a power issue. It's a problem of respect. When we are able to strip off the gender thing, then we'll get somewhere. Someone like Charlie Rose or Matt Lauer â€“ they are rock stars â€“ people look to them to say where are we going next. They exist in a bubble of power. And there's a lot of collateral damage to helping the bubble stay in the air. I don't think [these men] even remember these people are human with their own boundaries. The power monster is so fucking hungry and thuggish.And I think if we're truly going to drain the swamp, Trump can't be exempt. He has to be the ultimate example of someone who takes responsibility for his actions. It's not going to be comfortable to anybody. I think that if you're watching something happening and not doing anything, you're as guilty as the one committing the crime. So what does that say about all of us who sit by and look at the Oval Office?Heart helped popularize album-oriented rock, which paved the way for the macho rock-god archetype, complete with all the womanizing and decadence. But that plot line wasn't available to you.I always struggled with it, because I couldn't stand to be part of it. The early MTV years where we did go wearing the groupie clothes and the big hair â€“ those were the years I was unhappiest and the most uncomfortable in my own skin. Most other people I knew who were participating in all that thought it was a harmless little theater to sell units. But I was letting my own ideals go to hell.What did you feel you were losing?[Pauses] What I went through in the Eighties was more of a pressure to put out a Number One record â€“ and not being Kim Kardashian. It felt like, I'm not good enough unless I'm onstage in stilettos, a corset, with big fingernails and huge hair. In other words, having no depth.And everybody says ""Oh, you're so brilliant."" When really, what's so brilliant about working with a bunch of stylists? It's the stylist's work you're seeing, not mine [pauses]. What bothered me the most was I did it. I agreed to it. I thought, ""Well, if I want my career to continue, and I want to be on TV and have Number One records, I have to do these things."" It was sort of like hooking in a way. It really was â€“ the humiliation of doing that.So what do we do with stories like Led Zeppelin putting a mud shark in a woman's vagina? That's just one that comes to mind because they were such a huge influence on you.&nbsp;The Led Zeppelin mud-shark thing is a perfect example of rock stars feeling that, because they're onstage every night, they're kings of the world and the women afterward are subhuman. We know now that all people were consenting, but the behavior was wild and disrespectful. The female with the mud shark in her vagina was just as disrespectful to herself.A more contemporary consent issue might be â€“ to go back to Taylor Swift â€“ when Kanye West used her naked likeness in his music video allegedly without her permission. Do you think it was valid for West to use the ""art"" defense or not?That's an extremely sound question. That's what we're talking about with the introduction of rape culture as normalcy. I'd say, let's err on the side of it not being normal. Unless [Swift] gave consent to that and she thinks it's cool and she wants to go ahead with it, for sure. Otherwise, it's some kind of rape. That kind of publicity isn't doing anything for young women. Here, it seems it was used as an attack. And that's just evil.In the Eighties, was there an image or band that you found particularly demeaning?I remember the Robert Palmer videos with the identical models. That grossed me out, because it showed women as faceless, emotional robots. The individual was meaningless. That struck a chord. The models dancing onstage with Van Halen, I just thought, ""Boy, this does nothing promote the self-respect of women."" ... I think we were on the Ratt tour and the lead singer came up to me and planted this big sloppy one on the side of my face and Nancy pulled him off me [laughs]. That's up for interpretation.""I remember one day, I realized I was invisible. ... You become something that's not desirable, not fuckable.""Last time we spoke, about Chris Cornell's death, you said you felt lucky you survived. Was drinking the way you coped with the pressure of maintaining your career?&nbsp;Absolutely. It was a way of becoming a female Keith Richards, if you will. [I thought] since I'm not Tawny Kitaen or Pamela Anderson, then I'll go the other way. I was just like, ""Get me out of this disaster.""What about Nancy?&nbsp;She lived in a different world. She was married and a lot more moderate than I was with alcohol and drugs. She had that physical beauty that greased her into a lot of situations. I don't think the men we were touring with expected anything sinister [from her] because she is a beautiful, sunshine-y blond. She went into the other category. They didn't understand why I wasn't married; I was mouthy â€“ and that made me highly suspect. People didn't know how to treat me. In the concert reviews, they'd always have Nancy as the bright, pure angelic one and Ann as the raven-haired dominatrix.That speaks volumes about how good the music business is at shaming female artists.Shame is a big one. Shame is almost as powerful as getting fired and the combination of the two would be a persuasive reason to stay silent. But respecting yourself is more important than your career.&nbsp;What is your advice to musicians who feel too vulnerable to speak up?If you're being threatened or harassed somehow, and if you still think it's more important to feel like a prisoner all the time, then at the very least, you should get counseling. The more women stand up as individuals, the more this problem is going to come into focus.The music industry also controls and mitigates women through ageism. Have you experienced that?&nbsp;I remember one day ...&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized I was invisible. I could walk down the street. People start calling you ma'am. You become something that's not desirable, not fuckable. I remember talking to a record guy one time in the last 20 years. He had sought my help as a consultant and said, ""We're looking for the next Ann Wilson."" And inside, I'm like, ""Who does that make me? Just a space you're trying to fill? Are you trying to find the next Robert Plant?"" [Gasps] No. Never.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,Stephen Daw,2017-12-06T21:09:00.000Z,Inside the 'SpongeBob' Musical's All-Star Rock Soundtrack,"spongebob squarepants, spongebob musical, spongebob soundtrack, spongebob david bowie, spongebob flaming lips, spongebob broadway, spongebob plain white ts, spongebob wayne coyne",Rolling Stone,"When Tina Landau's agent asked her if she would be interested in directing a musical based on&nbsp;SpongeBob SquarePants, she replied with a blunt ""No.""""All that came to my head was a big, theme-parkâ€“style children's show with giant mascot heads and foam characters,"" she says. ""That did not interest me.""But when she learned that the cartoon's creator, Stephen Hillenburg, wanted the show to be as eccentric as his original concept of a talking kitchen sponge living in a piece of fruit underwater, she changed her tune and agreed to sign on. Now, her wacky, inventive vision of Bikini Bottom has just made its Broadway debut â€“ complete with a set of 18 songs&nbsp;penned by high-profile rock and pop artists ranging from the Flaming Lips, T.I. and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, to Panic! At the Disco, Sara Bareilles and even David Bowie.Tom Kitt, a Pulitzer-winning Broadway composer and the show's musical director, said that the key to making the project work was allowing the artists to write in their own voice. ""I very much wanted to make sure that the intention of the composition was really present,"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""As all of these layers of musical theater were being applied, it was important to make sure that the artists' voices were front and center.""In the early stages of developing the show, Landau and her creative team had outlined a basic plot (a volcano threatens to destroy Bikini Bottom and SpongeBob is tasked with saving the day) and song ideas. Once they had their list of potential songs, the team began asking one another who would be the best fit for each tune.When Tom Higgenson of pop-rockers Plain White T's received a call asking if he would contribute to the project, he was ecstatic. He had his sights set on writing a pirate sea shanty, but quickly realized why he had really been contacted.""There was this one song that was, like, a friendship love song between SpongeBob and Patrick [Star],"" Higgenson says. ""Once I saw that, it was like, 'OK, they're probably reaching out to the Plain White T's for the love song, not the pirate song.'""The song, ""BFF,"" sounds like a deep-cut off of an early Plain White T's record â€“ an acoustic guitar strums the melody while SpongeBob and Patrick sing sweetly about being best bros. ""They definitely embellished it and made room for those theatrical moments,"" Higgenson says. ""But the basis of the song is literally the same key and the same little parts and everything that I first recorded. It's pretty cool.""For the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, his involvement with SpongeBob SquarePants extended back to the 2004 SpongeBob movie soundtrack. The Lips' song on that record, ""SpongeBob &amp; Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy,"" confirmed for Landau that they were one of the essential acts she needed for this show.""I started saying very early on that this show should feel like a Flaming Lips concert,"" she said. ""There's confetti in the air and balls in the audience."" Coyne and the band were tasked with composing the show's Act One closer, ""Tomorrow Is,"" where the citizens of Bikini Bottom realize that they may only have one day left on Earth. According to Coyne, that drama is right within the Flaming Lips' wheelhouse.""We have these songs that kind of hint at the epic nature of life,"" the singer tells RS. ""Like a, 'If this is the last day on Earth, then make the most of it,' kind of thing. And I think [Tina] thought that we could naturally bring the drama that the show needed.""Throughout the songwriting process, Landau said that Coyne sent her a series of images of things like melting chocolate and ""psychedelic paint"" with little messages keeping her updated about where he was in the writing process. Coyne says that's something he often does when writing for other artists.""I think it's a nice way to let people know that you're still thinking about them,"" he says. ""But to be honest, I don't always put a lot of thought into the photos I send,"" he adds with a laugh. David Bowie also had a history with the SpongeBob franchise. The late icon had voiced the character of Lord Royal Highness in a 2007 episode of the TV show called ""Atlantis SquarePantis,"" so when Landau was considering who to contact, he seemed like a natural fit. When she reached out to Bowie in 2012, he said that he was very interested, but ""didn't have time"" to write an original song for the musical. ""I'm not sure where he was with his health at that point,"" Landau says. ""But he told us he wanted to contribute and asked us to go through his catalogue, and see if there was a song we could adapt.""Hoping to find a lesser-known Bowie song, Landau stumbled upon ""No Control,"" a B side from the singer's 1995 Brian Eno collaboration&nbsp;1. Outside. ""It seemed like quintessential Bowie, and it fit thematically with what we were doing,"" she says, referring to the show's apocalyptic plot. ""So with his blessing, we started adapting the music and lyrics to fit the show.""Only one other song from the show is an adapted piece: ""Best Day Ever"" was written by Andy Paley and Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob on the TV show, for a SpongeBob-themed album, though it was first heard in the franchise's 2004 movie.Kenny says that the Brian Wilsonâ€“inspired song encapsulates the character of SpongeBob perfectly. ""He totally believes every day is going to be the best day ever,"" he tells RS. ""Sometimes he gets his little square ass kicked, just like the rest of us, but as he goes to bed, he pushes a reset button and says, 'Maybe tomorrow.' And that is what is so key to him."" Ethan Slater, who plays the titular sponge in the musical, agrees that what makes the character special is his unwavering optimism. He says he tries to bring that idea to every song he performs in the show, despite how eclectic the compositions can be. ""I'm always sort of changing, stylistically, the way that I'm singing,"" he says. ""But it's never distinct from the character or the story."" Landau says that at the outset of this process, she was skeptical that she and her team would be able to realize their ambitious vision for the soundtrack. ""I'm still, to this day, surprised, but it ended up not being the logistical nightmare you might imagine it could have been,"" she says.But Kitt says he's not surprised that so many artists wanted to be involved with a show that is spreading a simple message of kindness and hope. ""Everyone loves this character and this world,"" he says. ""We all just feel blessed to bring joy and optimism to the world right now.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,Kory Grow,2017-12-19T16:32:04.088Z,Elvis Costello's New Year's Resolution: 'Enjoying Everything Still Enjoyable',"elvis costello,elvis costello interview,elvis costello pete the cat,pete the cat,elvis costello new year's resolution,elvis costello advice,elvis costello acting,elvis costello actor,elvis costello cartoon,elvis costello a face in the crowd",Rolling Stone,"Elvis Costello has found himself pondering some unusual questions lately. Like, say, ""What does a slightly absent-minded cat sound like?""On the upcoming animated children's special, Pete the Cat: A Groovy New Year, the quick-witted singer-songwriter plays the titular character's scatterbrained father. The show, which is based on illustrator and author James Dean's popular Pete the Cat book series, premieres on Amazon on December 26th. Jacob Tremblay (Room, Wonder) voices Pete, while Costello's wife Diana Krall plays Pete's mom; other voices include singer KT Tunstall, actor Atticus Shaffer (The Middle's Brick Heck) and Rolling Stones producer Don Was. For Costello, whose sons have read some of the books, it's been a welcome break from routine. ""I have only ever done a little bit of voicing before,"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""Heaven knows I have a face for the radio. But this is tremendous fun."" Costello came onto the show through previous work he'd done with showrunner Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh, and found character voicing comes with its own challenges. ""I had a cold the first day I went in, so I ended up with a very strange, nasal delivery,"" he says. ""I now have to find that voice every time.""In A Groovy New Year, Pete the Cat learns the meaning of a New Year's resolution â€“ something Costello doesn't take too seriously in real life. ""If you are in show business, you tend not to like New Year's,"" he says. ""You're usually playing, so it's mostly everybody else's holiday except yours.""Pressed for what his resolution would be for 2018, he says, ""To continue enjoying everything that still may be enjoyable in what's left of the world and in what's left of the time [in this world]."" He laughs. ""You want a hopeful answer? Let's hope for something better, and you can't just enjoy it â€“ you have to try for something better, as well. There is a lot of stuff that needs sorting out."" He pauses. ""Don't get me started.""Pete has a similar resolution on the show: to combine what he enjoys most â€“ making music, hanging out with his friends â€“ so he forms a band. ""I think it's a jolly good idea being in a band,"" Costello says with a laugh. ""Look at all the scrapes it got me into.""His advice for young musicians like Pete? Learn to manage expectations.&nbsp;""You have to really want to do it without the delusion that it's inherently going to change your fortunes,"" Costello says. ""It does for a very small portion of people. I see a lot of my younger friends who are very talented working hard and in another time and place, they would have probably been very well rewarded for their talents, because the business was set up in a different way for a little while. A lot of songs you hear today are about the process of fame and getting attention, and they don't have much else to say. But that's not to say they are no other songs. They're just not the ones in the public eye. Those who are, are mostly people regarding their own reflections, but that's just the season and then there will be time for another thing.""He also says that prospective artists should understand how the music industry works. ""I realize now that when [my band and I] were all in a little shop front office, taking 45 records out of blank sleeves and putting them in relatively cheaply produced printed sleeves with a logo on it that there was a bit of magic to that,"" he says. ""The bigger it got, the less personal and less connected it became, which is why you can't really find as many people high up in record companies that know the slightest thing about the thing they deal in. The owners certainly are not even music people at all. They could be counting stocks and shares in some other commodity, 'cause it is a commodity.""""The music industry completely different now,"" he continues. ""I can understand the magic of conjuring something up on your laptop in your room and delivering it straight to your audience. That's kind of the same thing as me recording to reel to reel and then this piece of plastic shows up in a shop and somebody knows my name â€“ or knows my fake name."" The singer, born Declan MacManus, laughs. ""So you just have to hold onto that thing that you love about it and not have it all bent out of shape by this other stuff that ultimately is beyond your control.""Costello is sticking true to his words and is currently working on an unusual musical project for him: a stage musical adaptation of novelist Budd Schulberg's screenplay A Face in the Crowd. ""It's from the Fifties and it's about the ability of television to make monsters,"" he says. ""I have written 19 really good songs, some of which I performed live to a very good response."" He's hoping it will be produced within the next year.He's also writing new, non-theatrical songs but he hasn't committed to making a new album out of them yet. ""Making a record is a much more difficult thing than it used to be, because people have to persuade themselves it's worth slapping down the greenbacks to get the songs onto tape or some recorded medium,"" he says.&nbsp;""Most people get their music these days in some sort of subscription service, so all the songwriter wants to do is suggest what order to listen to the songs in for the best effect. Beyond that, people usually make their own choices.""As for the music on Pete the Cat, Costello is enjoying singing other people's songs for now. ""I don't have any reason to write anything, other than singing a phrase a certain way, and I wouldn't call that writing,"" he says. ""People lay claim for doing next to nothing these days. You look at the credits on most pop records and there are 15 people involved. They haven't all been songwriters. They switched on a drum machine or something and that makes them a songwriter. It is what it is. I'm happy to sing other people's songs. Not everything has to be through gritted teeth â€“ or gritted claws.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,Jonathan Ringen,2017-11-27T17:38:00.000Z,Timbaland Comes Back From the Brink,"timbaland, timbaland projects, timbaland drugs, timbaland overdose, timbaland new music, oxycontin, justin timberlake timbaland, aaliyah, timbaland oxycontin, timbaland rolling stone",Rolling Stone,"Talk to any of Timothy ""Timbaland"" Mosley's friends, and you'll hear the same thing: that just a couple of years ago he was a totally different man. They'll tell you that he had lost his way, becoming depressed, overweight and contemptuous of the severely minimal beats that fueled hits by new artists like Future and Migos. He hadn't had a major success since BeyoncÃ©'s 2013 self-titled LP; his marriage was faltering; and his closest industry friends, the producers Pharrell Williams and Swizz Beatz, were concerned enough that they were checking in to give him pep talks. ""I felt like I wasn't committed, I was riding off ego,"" says Timbaland, 45, looking back. ""It was really about me neglecting my gift. As a producer and a soundmaker, I had to find out what God had in store for me.""Today things couldn't be more different for the producer, who is cheerfully chowing down on a bunless burger at a New York restaurant in November. Since the mid-1990s, the starkly futuristic robo-funk soundscapes he crafted for artists like Missy Elliott, Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake have shaped and reshaped modern pop and hip-hop. Now he's on track to have his hottest year in a decade, working with an entire Grammy ceremony's worth of talent on a slew of projects that are just beginning to make their way into the world. Foremost, he says he just wrapped up Timberlake's upcoming (and as yet officially unannounced) album, which will receive a massive boost when the star plays the Super Bowl halftime show in February. ""The music we just made?"" Timbaland says, shaking his head. ""It's gonna put him on another plateau."" He has a deeply soulful single, ""Pray,"" on Sam Smith's chart-topping new LP, which the singer performed on Saturday Night Live in October. Timbaland has launched collaborations with a new generation of rap talent, including Young Thug and Ty Dolla $ign. And he's been in the studio with Jay-Z, Zayn Malik, Chris Martin, Wiz Khalifa and Zac Brown, while also making clever moves into the booming post-""Despacito"" Latin market with tracks like Wisin and Bad Bunny's ""Move Your Body."" ""His music shaped me as an artist and as a songwriter,"" says Smith. ""He works with so much kindness and attention to detail, and even after all of his success, he still loves music more than ever.""&nbsp;At New York's hip ABC Kitchen, a favorite spot when Timbaland is visiting from his home in Miami, he shows off the results of his intense boxing-based fitness regimen (inspired, he says, by the Rock and Kevin Hart) in a skintight gray Nike tracksuit. He's lost 40 pounds, and isn't done yet. ""I've never felt better,"" he says. ""I'm doing stuff I never knew I could do."" At the same time, he's found new ways of working, increasingly skipping big, expensive studios to make tracks at home using the software Ableton Live â€“ which he rocks while wearing headphones and a rig called a Subpac, a backpack-slash-vest gizmo with speakers built into it. ""You put it on and it makes you feel like you're in the studio,"" he says. ""The sound is three-dimensional."" ""All I can tell you is that there was a light,"" he says [of awaking after a near-fatal overdose]. ""I woke up trying to catch my breath, like I was underwater.""So what inspired this burst of productivity? Midway through lunch, Timbaland lowers his voice and leans forward. ""I was on drugs, dude,"" he says. ""I was on OxyContin."" Timbaland started taking pain medication in his thirties, to help with nerve issues resulting from a gunshot wound he suffered as a teenager. But his use spun out of control, and as his drug intake increased, his chart success declined, he blew through a lot of his money and his marriage collapsed â€“ fueling a vicious cycle of depression and addiction. ""Music is a gift and curse,"" he says. ""Once you're not popping, it plays with your mind. The pills helped block out the noise â€“ I'd just sleep all day. I remember Jay-Z told me one time, 'Don't do no more interviews' â€“ because I was saying crazy shit."" His now-girlfriend, Michelle, recalls that at the end Timbaland was taking doses so high that she was genuinely worried he'd die in his sleep. ""It was so bad, to the point where I couldn't even sleep,"" she says. ""I'd put my hand right by his nose, just to see if he was still breathing."" He eventually did suffer what he believes to be a near-death overdose while sleeping three years ago. ""All I can tell you is that there was a light,"" he says. ""I woke up trying to catch my breath, like I was underwater. But through that whole thing I saw life â€“ I saw where I would be if I don't change, and where I could be if I did."" The following day he began weaning off the pills, and soon after made a clean break â€“ which resulted in a brutal period of withdrawal. ""But I thought about Michael Jackson,"" he says. ""I didn't want to be old and taking these pills.""He's not judgmental about other people's partying â€“ he still smokes some weed, and is enjoying a whiskey cocktail with lunch â€“ but he feels compelled to talk about his experience in the wake of the deaths of Chris Cornell, a friend and collaborator who had long battled addiction, and Prince, who was probably Timbaland's greatest music hero. ""I came from the era of drug dealers [making rap hits],"" he notes. ""Now we're in the era of drug users."" He especially wants young fans and musicians to be aware that counterfeit pain pills could contain powerful opiates like fentanyl, and for the music industry as a whole to be more cognizant of the prevalence of depression in the hip-hop community. ""These kids come from a place where they don't have money, don't have a real home,"" he says. ""It affects them, and you hear it in the music."" (Less than a week after this interview, the rapper Lil Peep, 21, who had struggled with drug use and depression, died before a concert in Arizona of what appeared to be a Xanax overdose.)These days, Timbaland is focused on just a fewthings: being a parent to his 10-year-old daughter, Reign, getting seriouslyfit and making as much great music as possible. He's cranking away on a soloLP, which will be out next year and features collaborations with Timberlake,Malik and Rick Ross. He's even come to appreciate the sounds he hears on theradio by producers, like Metro Boomin, he once maligned â€“ and has sought outyoung MCs like the much-hyped Florida rapper $ki Mask the Slump God to pushhip-hop sonics to the next level. ""Right now, I feel like what I can dowith my legacy is to give back,"" Timba-land says. ""Which meansfinding the youth of today. Look at Quincy Jones â€“ he was 50 when he did Thriller! What's my Thriller? That's the goal.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,Kory Grow,2018-01-19T19:06:23.752Z,Def Leppard Explain Why They Finally Embraced Streaming,"def leppard,def leppard interview,joe elliott,joe elliott interview,def leppard streaming,joe elliott streaming,def leppard catalogue,def leppard spotify,def leppard tidal,def leppard apple music",Rolling Stone,"For years, Def Leppard were well situated among the ranks of Garth Brooks and Tool as holdouts on streaming services â€“ artists with large, multiplatinum catalogues that still didn't feel comfortable with the pros and cons of subscription-based music schemes. The hard rockers had long been at war with their label, Universal, about the topic, even recording self-described ""forgeries"" of ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" and ""Rock of Ages"" that were self-released so they would earn what they considered a fair wage. ""We just sent [the label] a letter saying, 'No matter what you want, you are going to get ""no"" as an answer, so don't ask,'"" Elliott said in 2012.But things have changed. Beginning Friday, fans can stream all of the band's major releases, going back to their 1979 debut, The Def Leppard E.P., on all major streaming services. ""We needed the right deal for the band,"" frontman Joe Elliott tells Rolling Stone. ""We weren't going to be victims of the industry. We signed our deal with Mercury many, many decades ago when there was no digital part of the record deal. So when [our contract ended] in 2009, we were free to do whatever we wanted to do. We were so busy touring and not worrying about the back catalogue â€“ because people were still buying CDs â€“ that we weren't sure about [embracing] streaming.""Elliott recalls label reps telling them that streaming was the great new thing but feeling incredulous after seeing artists releasing songs that got ""125,000,000 listens and a check for $120."" The singer says the band isn't in it for the money, but that he wanted a digital deal to be fair. ""We came to the conclusion that it's not going to do us any harm, but the deal had to be right,"" he says. ""These things just don't happen overnight.""The band was on board to put its music on streaming ""quite awhile ago,"" by Elliott's estimation, but the deals kept falling apart. One concern they had was getting everything out at once across all major services. ""We didn't want certain albums on one service and others through another one,"" he says. ""So negotiating everything with different places just takes time."" So they waited for the right opportunity to come to them. ""It's not like a make-or-break thing, whether we do it or not,"" Elliott says. ""So we didn't and just went off on our own.""One of the reasons things worked out this time, the singer says, was a regime shift at Universal. ""It makes life easier,"" he says. ""We were able to come to the decision that it was the right thing to do and have it all come out at once. So now you've got everything form the very first EP we did back in 1979 â€“ which is what got us our record deal in the first place â€“ all the way up to the last album that came out in 2015.""The last puzzle piece for the band was the timing. ""We don't like things to dribble,"" Elliott says. ""We don't like to release information in drips and drops if there's no big pow. We like a good explosion in our announcement."" He laughs. They timed the announcement to coincide with a massive summer tour with Journey. ""It's put the excitement back into this thing we've been doing for 40 years,"" he says. ""It makes it worthwhile, really.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,Andy Greene,2018-01-22T16:06:16.118Z,Hear Clarence Clemons in His Final Rolling Stone Interview,"Clarence Clemons, Clarence Clemons Lady Gaga, Clarence Clemons podcast, Clarence Clemons interview, clarence clemons bruce springsteen, bruce springsteen, clarence clemons death, clarence clemons jackson browne, clarence clemons gaga songs, ",Rolling Stone,"In February of 2011, Lady Gaga went onto Ryan Seacrest's radio show to talk about her upcoming album Born This Way for the very first time. She was at the height of her fame, and her army of Little Monsters were eager for any scrap of information they could get their paws on. But the name of one collaborator she threw out must have puzzled some of her young fans: Clarence Clemons. Gaga is a big Bruce Springsteen fan, but the E Street Band saxophonist wasn't exactly a big part of the 2000s pop landscape.As soon as the news hit, we put in an interview request to talk to the Big Man himself about how this all went down. Much to our surprise, he happily called us up the next day and was delighted to talk about Gaga and anything else we felt like exploring with him. The E Street Band hadn't played in well over a year at the time, and Clarence's health problems were well known, but he was in great spirits â€“ which made his death from a stroke just four months later all the more stunning. We released parts of the interview back in 2011, but in honor of his 76th birthday this month we ran much of the interview on the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast, and have included the full transcript here. To hear the conversation, see below or download and subscribe to the show on iTunes or Spotify.&nbsp;How did this collaboration with Lady Gaga happen?It was her idea. Someone over at her camp called me up and said, ""Lady Gaga wants you to play on her album if that's possible."" This was on a Friday afternoon. I said, ""Yeah, okay, I'd be glad to do it. When do you want me to do it? Monday or Tuesday?"" They said, ""No, she needs you now."" [Laughs] It was kind of funny. I had to fly into New York that same day.You drove right to the airport?Yep. I think I almost got a ticket.Wow.This whole thing was so wild. I was so excited. Man, she is it. And all the things I thought about her, I was right. She's a genius.You went right to the studio and she was there?Yeah. I got there close to midnight. I walked into the studio and she came running down the hall, ""Yeah! Big Man!"" [Laughs] Shit. I was like, ""Holy shit, man. Damn."" She's a great person and I had so much fun. Just so much fun.What did she tell you about the song ""Hair"" that you played on?It's a story about growing up. Her parents didn't want her to grow her hair or whatever it was, but it just made so much sense when she told me the story. I'm still really excited about it. The fact that I was asked to play on her album was one of the greatest things that ever happened in my life. I am a real fan of her approach to what she's saying. All the things that some people see as crazy, it makes so much sense. She's just a great, great person. When I left the studio, it took me a few days to come down. Just being witness to what she's saying and actually getting there is amazing.What instructions did she give you before you played your part?She just told me the story of the song and said, ""Just play. Put the tape on and where you feel it, play it."" And I did and she loved it. I played on three songs. I mean, I could have stayed for three weeks and just done that. It was so chill and so real. It came from a place inside me that was inspired by her. She didn't tell me what to do. She said, ""Just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.""What's she like in person? Is it similar to her public persona?She's the real deal. I mean, all the craziness and stuff, it's purposeful. I had no idea. You see people sometimes and you draw conclusions, but the conclusion is wrong because there's no boundaries in the thing she does She's justâ€_she's it.So, how is your health these days, Clarence?Good. You know, something like this makes me feel a lot better, you know. [Laughs] Something like this is inspiring, plus the possibility of going on tour with her. Wouldn't that be great?Are they talking about that?No, we didn't talk about anything like that. We were so involved and engrossed in the place that we were in right then.Might you play with her at some point?I don't know. I have no anticipation, but I would love it. I'd love to do it if she asked me. [Note: Clarence's final public performance was with Lady Gaga on American Idol in May of 2011.]&nbsp;Did you have back surgery recently?Yeah, spinal surgery. I had both my knees replaced. I had spinal fusion and some L2s, L5s. I had a lot of things.The spinal surgery is the most recent one?The spinal surgery and the knee replacement both happened within the last year. I've had hips replaced. I've had all kinds of replacements. It hasn't held me back. Everything happens at the right time and the timing was perfect. It didn't interfere with a lot of stuff that was going on in my life. When I had the last surgery, I knew I had to do it, because the last tour [in 2009 supporting Working on a Dream] was hell. It was pure hell. At the same time, it was wonderful. It was beautiful to me. Isn't that something?I have played with two of the greatest people, the greatest musicians, the greatest artists, probably alive. It's a beautiful thing. Although I had all these problems, it didn't hold me back. This made me stronger and made me work harder. I've been in physical therapy for the past year, few days a week, working my ass off to get back [in shape.] And the music I'm involved with has really helped me hold it together. It has helped me be stronger because of my love for what I do.Are there any more surgeries planned?I don't know what else they could do. [Laughs] What else is left to replace? I got everything just about covered now. But whatever it takes to do what I gotta do, I'll do it.Are you walking better now?Yeah, I'm walking better. I still use a cane and now I'm having some hip problems again. I don't know why. But it hasn't stopped me from playing music. As long as my mouth and my hands and my brain still work, I'll be out there doing it, man.I've heard some talk of a 2012 E Street Band tour. Is that something you know about?No, but I do believe that could be true. It may be true. There's always rumors about stuff around Bruce and it's always pretty true. When it comes to music and what the band is doing, yes, we are going to do it again. I always say that I think we'll do it again. But after that, is Gaga going gonna decide to go out? I don't know. If both of them came to pass in the same year, the same two years or whatever, it would just beâ€_I can't even think like that. It's so crazy. [Laughs] The one thing I would love to do is have the chance to go out with both of them.You turn 70 next year. Do you see any moment where you would stop touring?I'm gonna keep going until I'm not there anymore. That is what's keeping me alive and feeling young and inspired. My spiritual teacher, Sri Chinmoy, told me that my purpose in life is to bring joy and light to the world. And I don't know any better way to do that than what I'm doing right now.I've got some random fan questions if you don't mind.Okay. I'll try my best.The fans are fascinated by the Nebraska album and whether or not the full band tried to record some of those songs.I think when Bruce brings in the band in on the music, he knows what he wants and he knows what he hears. He places it where it wants to be. So it's not a matter of ""try it and make it fit,"" it fits naturally or it does not.So the band didn't try to record those songs as a full band?No. As a full band, I don't think so.Did you buy Human Touch and Lucky Town when they came out? What were your thoughts on those albums at the time?At that point in his life, that is what he wanted to say. I'm a Bruce fan and whatever he does is fine with me.You love ""Sad Eyes,"" right?I love it. Musically, it's one of his greatest vocal tracks.So you record the song ""Born To Run,"" and then Ernest ""Boom"" Carter and David Sancious quit the band. Did you think they were crazy?Yeah, I did. The way it went down is that we were playing in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. At the start of the show, Bruce told me they were leaving. I thought he meant they were going home or something. And Ernest was living with me at the time and he never told me they were going to leave. They never told me anything about it. I had no idea. I was just taken aback. We had gotten pretty close and I thought that he would have said something to me. It came as a big shock, a very big disappointment.I have a 2002 tour rider here and it says you get a whole roast chicken in the middle of the show. Is that something they did back then?No. But I did have dinner after the show.But not in the middle?No, no! Jeez, there wasn't time to get of and eat. That's a funny think to think about. [Laughs]What are your memories of shooting Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?We shot it somewhere out west. I can't remember where. Anyways, I was like, ""Wow! This is very surprising."" It came along all of a sudden and it wasn't one of those things I had wished for or even thought about. They called me and I was like, ""Wow!"" We didn't shoot a lot of rehearsal. That happened pretty naturally for me, that part I played in the movie.Why do you think Bruce recorded so many albums that he shelved back in the day?Well, he had these expressions he wanted to make and we were at a point where we couldn't play in the studio, but he was still writing. I think he just says, ""A song ain't a song until somebody hears it."" He's just a prolific writer. People who know about this kind of thing, that's why he writes so much. Put it down and make sure you can always come back and get it if you need. There are parts of a song you might need for something else coming down the road or something so crazy that you don't want to forget it or lose it. So, a song ain't a song until someone hears it. It's a thought. If you write it, put it on tape, it's a song.You almost played for the Cleveland Browns, right?Almost! I was going in as a free agent, trying out for the team. My best friend who I was in college with, he's two years ahead of me, Charlie Holmes, he's one of the greatest running backs I've ever met, even up to this day. He said, ""Oh, come down and try out for this team I'm playing with, the Jersey Generals."" And I went down and tried out for the team. Then there was a car accident that knocked me out of football. I guess I never really tried out for the team, but I knew I could have made it. But the doctors thought it wouldn't be a good idea. It was at the top of the season and I was in peak physical condition.&nbsp;Charlie and I used to work out together and we became even closer friends. He asked me if I wanted to try this job out first. He was a supervisor at this Jersey reform school for boys. My minor was sociology. So I had this job, which came after football.Do you ever think about how different your life would have turned out if you hadn't been in that car accident?Well yeah, it would have been a lot different. That's why some things happen in your past. You can't understand why it happened, but it happened for a reason. Things happen in your life for a reason. If you're wise enough and understand it, it makes your life easier instead of complaining about shit all the time. You've got to play the hand you're dealt. At the end, you'll see that what you decided was probably the right thing. I never thought I'd be a quote ""rock and roll star."" I just loved to play. And then I met Bruce right after the car accident.One last question: In the mid-1980s, who could have bench-pressed more, you or Bruce?Me, definitely. Without a doubt. [Laughs] I don't know about now.&nbsp;Download and subscribe to Rolling Stone Music Now on iTunes or Spotify, and tune in Fridays at 1 p.m. ET to hear the show broadcast live on Sirius XM's Volume, channel 106.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,Kory Grow,2018-01-30T17:41:00.000Z,"Grammys 2018: Artists Sound Off on Sexism, Equality, Power of White Rose",white rose,Rolling Stone,"When the Grammys rolled into New York City Sunday night, it appeared the only #MeToo moment would be Kesha's rousing, star-studded performance of ""Praying"" preceded by Janelle Monae's impassioned call to arms. But earlier in the week, a group of 16 women in the music industry, drawing inspiration from the Time's Up initiative that asked women to wear black to the Golden Globes, formed the organization Voices in Entertainment and led a charge for people to wear white roses to the event. On the red carpet before the show, about half of the artists appeared to be wearing or carrying white roses â€“ hardly the show of force at the Golden Globes. Some people simply hadn't heard about the freshly formed initiative. But the dozens of musicians and producers who spoke with Rolling Stone both on the carpet and backstage said that they supported the cause and pointed to specific ways the music industry could transform to be more inclusive, equal and safe for all.Cyndi Lauper drew an intense face when the subject came up backstage after she joined Kesha for ""Praying."" ""It's time that sisters stand together,"" Lauper told Rolling Stone. ""It's time that human beings grow as a society and fix things that don't work so we have equality. This is a fixable thing. [Women] are 51 percent of the workforce, OK? This is fixable.""But the music industry hardly reflects U.S. census numbers. A recent study reported that only 22.4 percent of the performers on the top 600 songs from 2012 to 2017 on Billboard's year-end Hot 100 chart were women. While the study's pop-focused parameters overlooked certain niche genres in which female performers dominate, it also reported that only 9.3 percent of the 899 people nominated for Grammys in the last six years were women. This year, the only female lead artists to be nominated in the Album, Record and Song of the Year categories were Lorde for Melodrama and Julia Michaels for ""Issues.""""Women who are musicians are so used to being around men that they hold their own and don't put up with any crap."" - Susan Tedeschi""The statistics are horrible,"" Michaels' ""Issues"" cowriter Justin Tranter told Rolling Stone on the red carpet before the show. ""I think that because we have these big female pop stars, people forget that women and marginalized people are so underrepresented in this business.""""I think the industry is just a reflection of American society,"" adds Rapsody, who was nominated in the Best Rap Song and Rap Album categories. ""If you look at our president's cabinet, it's mostly white men. So across the board, we have to come together and be voices for every industry to change and accept women and equality in those areas.""Some artists said they didn't feel the disparity between women and men in music that the numbers suggested. When Rolling Stone read the numbers to Sting, who wore a white rose, on the red carpet, he turns his head and says, ""Is that true? It doesn't feel like it."" He adds, ""I think the music industry more than any other entertainment industry is more integrated in many ways in terms of gender and race. We're not perfect by any means â€“ I think there's room for improvement â€“ but I hope there's no skeletons in the closet.""And in a sharp contrast to the way Hollywood has embraced the conversation, other artists and industry people who spoke with Rolling Stone suggested that women needed to take more of an interest in playing music because the opportunities are there for them. ""More women could be doing music perhaps than there are now, and we would look forward to that,"" Recording Academy president Neil Portnow says on the red carpet. ""Trends change. I remember years ago when you would hear about the radio playing only female artists, and now we're not so beholden to radio, so the opportunities are there.""&nbsp;On Tuesday, Pink issued a sharp rebuke to Portnow, who provoked criticism after telling&nbsp;Variety that women need ""to step up because I think they would be welcome.â€ù (He has since walked back his quote.)""It's embarrassing that it's taken this long to get to this point."" - Mastodon's Brann DailorSimilarly, Reba McEntire, who wore a white rose and won the Grammy for Best Roots Gospel Album for her Sing It Now album, thinks things like women's underrepresentation on the charts are cyclical. ""In the Nineties, women dominated the charts,"" the singer says. ""If you were a publisher, you couldn't get the writers to write a song for the guys [then] because the women were hot. It'll come back.""""When I did 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun,' it was because I just wanted all girls to see themselves and know that they were entitled to a joyful experience in life and not misery,"" Lauper adds. ""It was freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of religion â€“ all the things our country is supposedly based on.""Susan Tedeschi, who walked the carpet with her husband and bandmate, Derek Trucks, says she reluctantly grew to accept a lack of gender equality as she grew up. ""There was never a huge amount of women in the music industry other than singers,"" she says. When asked about why she felt the music industry was slow to embrace the #MeToo movement, Tedeschi says, ""I think honestly women who are musicians are so used to being around men that they hold their own and don't put up with any crap. I hate to say that but it's true."" When pressed that some don't have a choice, she replies, ""Well, that, too, but then they'll usually come out and say something or avoid the situation but it's still going to happen.""Trucks, for his part, offered that he would feel ""uncomfortable"" for the couple's daughter to go into the music business. ""It all depends on the type of music you're playing, and what you're in it for, if you want to go into it for fame and notoriety,"" he explains. ""There are a lot of traps along the way.""""It's a total boys' club,"" Tranter says. ""For the most part, it's straight white men running these labels and publishing companies. I'm fortunate that I have a female publisher and her boss is a man of color. My world is a little more diverse, but the majority of the business is not diverse at all.""For some, the music industry's structure may put it at a disadvantage when it comes to speaking out about inequality.&nbsp;""Music's a little more decentralized than Hollywood is,"" Trucks says. Mastodon drummer Brann Dailor, who wore a white-rose pin, suggested that the situation within music hasn't come into view in the music industry because there are fewer opportunities like awards shows where artists can embrace a movement and bring it to the public's attention. ""It's embarrassing that it's taken this long to get to this point,"" Dailor says.Lisa Loeb, the ""Stay"" singer who won a Grammy this year for Feel What U Feel in the Best Children's Album category, agreed that a dearth of tentpole events has stunted the conversation. ""We [musicians] are in the studios, we're on tour, we're so far apart from each other when we're working that it's hard to join together like we do at something like the Grammys,"" she says. ""The music industry needs to be part of this movement to speak out ... people listen to musicians and musicians believe in equality and supporting each other and each other's stories.""It's also a matter of changing times, she says. Lately, she's been excited to see her eight-year-old daughter embrace playing electric guitar. ""It's a totally normal thing that a girl would have an electric guitar â€“ literally a girl, not a woman,"" she says. ""Many years ago, when I was a kid, it was very wild that I had an electric guitar. It was unheard of.""But even as times change, there are many barriers that women in the music industry are grappling with daily. K.Flay, who was up for Best Rock Song and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, says it's still hard for women to make an impact on radio. ""I saw a huge change [in my career] once I got played on terrestrial radio, and that is such a male- dominated and -controlled industry,"" she says. ""I think some of those gatekeepers are just giving more airtime and opportunities to male artists in that genre. Rock music, historically, is a 'masculine, aggressive' genre that hasn't been welcoming to women. I hope that's changing.""""Underneath all anger is grief and after the grief is done, there's bliss because we can heal. [But] we still have to speak up."" - Cyndi LauperAnd Jenny Conlee, pianist for the Decemberists, says she still feels the gender barrier on tour. ""We were at Big Day Out in Australia with maybe 30 bands and there were two women â€“ Peaches and Katy Perry â€“ other than myself,"" she says. ""Peaches came up to me and was like, 'Here we are. Isn't this wild that we are so underrepresented here?' and I don't think about it, because I usually feel like we are all sort of genderless in this weird music way, but actually when you look at it, there are more peewees than vajays onstage."" She laughs and adds, ""I think girls need to start playing music. Maybe girls don't want to be in bands, I don't know, but I think it's a great career and they should aspire to that and study music.""Some say that it's something that is slowly changing. Jain, a French pop artist whose striking, human-rightsâ€“themed ""Makeba"" clip was up for Best Music Video, says she's seen ""a lot of young women starting to record themselves on their own computer"" in France, but that she'd like to see women support one another more. ""There's so [many] men controlling the music industry,"" she says on the red carpet. ""We women don't encourage each other enough. I hope the next generation is going to be strong and fierce.""""I think if the music industry was 50/50, there wouldn't be so much competition [among women],"" Bebe Rexha, who accompanied Kesha during ""Praying,"" says backstage after the performance. ""I don't think we would be fighting each other and hating on each other, which I think a lot for times girls do. It's important to change that.""Similarly, a sense of unity is what brought Lauper to this year's Grammys. The reason she wanted to participate in Kesha's show of force, she says, was because ""nobody believed [Kesha],"" when the singer accused producer Dr. Luke of drugging her and sexually assaulting her. ""How would people [who doubted her] react if that happened to them?"" she exclaimed, looking agitated. (Dr. Luke has denied all charges.)""I had a lot of weird things happen to me in my life, but I always learned from it,"" Lauper says. ""I'm still standing. I come from a long line of strong women. My grandmother couldn't speak English. She was in an arranged marriage with her cousin and she was treated like a fucking servant. Women are treated badly. And maybe it's my Sicilian background, but I do know underneath all anger is grief and after the grief is done, there's bliss because we can heal. We're not at that point yet. We still have to speak up.""Additional reporting by Sarah Grant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,Jason Newman,2017-11-07T17:19:00.000Z,How Nicole Atkins Quit Drinking and Discovered Her Inner Soul Singer,"nicole atkins, nicole atkins new album, nicole atkins new song, nicole atkins rhonda lee, nicole atkins interview, nicole atkins feature, nicole atkins chris isaak, nicole atkins drinking, nicole atkins rehab",Rolling Stone,"It had been a week since&nbsp;Nicole Atkins checked herself in for a month-long stint at a California alcohol rehab center. It was March of 2015, months before the 39-year-old Nashville-via-New Jersey singer-songwriter would begin working on her new album in earnest. Between getting sober and caring for a father who, on her first day in rehab, entered surgery after a lung-cancer diagnosis, recording was hardly her main concern.But after meeting a fellow musician at the facility, a new career phase began. ""I got the idea of committing to more of a soul sound for this record when I was in rehab,"" she says over lunch in New York. ""There was a music producer in there. I won't say who he is, but totally different style than me. A hip-hop guy. One day, he's like, 'Play me your stuff.' He said, 'You're really good, but you need to stop fucking around with this indie-rock bullshit. You're a soul singer. Just do what you do.'""The ""indie-rock bullshit"" had served Atkins well over the course of three critically acclaimed albums: 2007's Neptune City, 2011's Mondo Amore and 2014's Slow Phaser. Now, the producer's words kept ringing in her head. At one point during her stay, Atkins says she had a dream that she wrote an Aretha Franklin song before waking up, running to the bathroom and recording the chorus under her breath on her Kindle.The song would become ""Sleepwalking,"" a breezy standout track from Atkins' latest album Goodnight Rhonda Lee. Atkins' breadth on the album â€“ both vocally and musically&nbsp;â€“ is astounding, with the buoyant pop of ""Listen Up"" and brash, Dap-Kingâ€“assisted funk of ""Brokedown Luck"" melding with the mournful nostalgia of ""I Love Living Here (Even When I Don't)"" and rootsy country vibe of the title track.But Atkins' voice, alternating between sultry croon and soulful belt&nbsp;â€“ ""Big singing has always been my thing,"" she says â€“ remains the steady anchor. Friend and veteran singer-songwriter Chris Isaak, whose band took Atkins on her first tour in 2007, pushed her to emphasize her voice more in the mix. Isaak co-wrote ""A Little Crazy,"" a torch song about a real-life ex that balances heartbreak with resilience, and the title track. For Atkins, it was not exactly their first collaboration. ""I had [Chris'] poster on my wall when I was in high school,"" Atkins says. ""I used to jerk off to it every day after school.""In person, Atkins is as refreshingly unfiltered as on record; a fast-talking New Jersey native whose blunt affability and natural gift for storytelling recalls Amy Winehouse. Asked about the titular Rhonda Lee, which ""started as my bowling alias, but became my drunken hag alias,"" Atkins, now sober, explains the dichotomy of the alcoholic and why she is saying ""good night"" to that part of her life. ""In my element, I could've been the best fucking thing you've ever seen where I'll get us a free limo ride to the party in Brooklyn and free drugs and then we'll go get steak and eggs in the morning, or I'll say horrible things to your wife,"" she says. ""There was no telling.""It's this unashamed frankness that also became a key factor in her decision to get sober. ""The biggest thing that helped me is being open about it and not feeling like it's something to be embarrassed about,"" Atkins says. ""Finding help where it's offered has been helpful to me.""Growing up in Asbury Park, New Jersey, Atkins became obsessed with the Who at an early age while absorbing the Fifties and Sixties music constantly wafting from both her mother's stereo and the town's&nbsp;boardwalk. A cassette tape her mom bought at a gas station called Cruisin' Classics turned her on to artists like the Drifters, Jay Black and the Americans, and Jackie Wilson â€“ perennial ""oldies"" radio stalwarts but rarely the inspiration for fledgling singer-songwriters in the 1980s and beyond.""I couldn't drink without blacking out. I'm making a record and I'm in my element and I feel nothing.""&nbsp;A self-confessed ""hard partier"" since around age 12 (""whenever people started getting Starter jackets""), Atkins says her bouts with alcohol got darker after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. ""I couldn't drink without blacking out,"" she admits. ""After Sandy, shit just got sloppy.  I'm making a record and I'm in my element and I feel nothing. I just went to bed for three nights in a row crying. Sandy was the realization of seeing that nothing is permanent and everything can change at any moment. The place that you thought would be there from when you're born until you die may not.""After a lifetime in the Northeast, Atkins relocated with her husband to Nashville in October 2015. ""I hated it. The first year was horrible,"" she admits. ""I was five months sober, but I was just losing it. I was itchy as shit and started drinking again and relapsing off and on. It felt like I was just floating in space and not knowing what I was doing.""She'd still write constantly, but in Nashville, Atkins was now meeting with ""a bunch of people talking about algorithms [and] bullshit co-writes."" In one meeting, an executive asked her if she had any songs with the word ""miracle"" in it to match an advertiser's target keyword list. ""Yeah, it's a miracle I didn't fucking die,"" she says with a laugh.She eventually would find new friends and new non-algorithmic inspiration. While writing Rhonda&nbsp;song ""Darkness Falls So Quiet,"" Atkins took the track, originally a country song, and sang it over the groove from blues and soul legend Bobby ""Blue"" Bland's ""Rockin' in the Same Old Boat.""&nbsp;The musical shift helped Atkins discover an identity only hinted at on past albums.&nbsp;""In the 1960s, you knew who the person was by what they sang,"" she says. ""I always do these benefit shows where you do cover songs and it's like, 'I should write some stuff that I like singing at these kind of things but that are just mine.' I had to get out of this mindset that it couldn't be done.""&nbsp;Much of Goodnight Rhonda Lee focuses on transformations both geographical and internal, with the album detailing the joys and horrors of uprooting your life and starting over.Though Atkins' transformations were a long time coming, the recording itself happened quickly.&nbsp;Once the songs were in near-finished form, Atkins decamped to Fort Worth, Texas to track the album live to tape in less than a week with musicians she had just met face-to-face days earlier. ""It took three years to write and five days to record,"" Atkins says. ""The previous albums had a lack of grit and lack of mistakes that I wanted to hear. I wanted it to sound real.""These days, Rhonda Lee is gone, replaced by a singer whose admitted enemies are ""depression and excitement."" ""I require consistency from my friends,"" Atkins says. ""How can I require that from somebody else if I can't do that myself? Rhonda would've either gone skydiving or just killed herself and everybody else. I'm just excited that I have all this room in my brain now to just do music. It's a very fun place to be.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,Steve Knopper,2017-11-16T19:31:00.000Z,The Rope: The Forgotten History of Segregated Rock & Roll Concerts,"The Platters, the Flamingos, the Coasters, Lloyd Price, segregated concerts, segregated rock and roll, rock and roll and Jim Crow, jim crow laws, segregations laws, civil rights and rock & roll",Rolling Stone,"One night in the late 1950s, the Flamingos' bus pulled up to a concert hall in Birmingham, Alabama, and a row of 30 to 50 police officers holding rifles and billy clubs was waiting for them. The cops escorted the six-member doo-wop group, famous for ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" and ""The Ladder of Love,"" to its dressing room and gave strict instructions: As black performers, they were to make eye contact with only the black fans, who were confined to the balcony, and not with whites on the floor. ""It was ridiculous,"" recalls Terry Johnson, now 78, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fameâ€“inducted group. ""The cops were up there making sure we did not look at any white person. It was a rule when we came in: 'I don't want to see any of you darkies looking at the white women out there. If you do, your ass is mine.' Cruel things like that.""The Flamingos, like all African-American performers from that era, had to contend with Jim Crow absurdities. Often they couldn't stay at hotels, were served rotten food at white restaurants and were outright banned from others; they would instead drive out of the way to eat at black friends' homes. But that Birmingham performance stayed with Johnson.""We were personalities. To say you can't look at someone who's smiling and applauding for you?"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""It was hard. I'll never forget that.""In the Fifties and Sixties, black performers found themselves on the front lines of the battle over segregation. The clashes at lunch counters, schools and on buses have been well documented, but reporters weren't exactly covering James Brown club shows back then, so we're reliant on survivors' biographies and oral recollections for the details. As the original rock &amp; roll pioneers are fading out â€“ Fats Domino died in October, Chuck Berry died at 90 last March, 84-year-old Little Richard has been intermittently sick, and most of the members of groups like the Flamingos are gone â€“ it's more important than ever to share their stories.Rock &amp; roll, with its mixture of white country music and black R&amp;B, arrived just as segregationists were tightening Jim Crow laws in response to the civil rights movement. Entertainers throughout the South were forced to participate in a crowd-separation ritual. Venues could be unofficially classified black or white â€“ New Orleans' famous Dew Drop Inn catered to an exclusively African-American crowd, for example. But in other cases, police and promoters physically separated the audiences. Sometimes, as in the Flamingos' show, blacks were in the balcony and whites on the floor; other times, a painted line ran down the center of the theater or a rope bifurcated the audience.In 1955, Berry performed at the Duval Armory, in Jacksonville, Florida, and recalled in his autobiography, ""Just before they were to open the doors for the spectators, four of the maintenance guys came out and roped off the armory with white window cord. They looped and tied it to each seat down the center aisle, making it an off-limits zone that neither colored nor whites could tread."" Berry also wrote that he once showed up for a Knoxville, Tennessee, concert only to find a group of white men had replaced him with a local cover band: ""It's a country dance and we had no idea that 'Maybellene' was recorded by a niggra man,"" one said.Historically, some concert-segregation laws had been haphazardly enforced, depending on the state and the racial attitudes of local officials and police officers. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, an interracial, all-woman jazz group, managed to get away with integrated concerts when they toured the South in the 1940s, although they were occasionally turned away from entire towns and members were hauled to prison.""There may have been more potential leeway and latitude, and a little bit of a blind eye being turned, prior to 1954-55,"" says Brian Ward, a Northumbria University professor in England and author of 1998's Just My Soul Responding: Rhythm and Blues, Black Consciousness, and Race Relations. ""The South begins to mobilize, in a much more concerted way, these forces of massive resistance â€“ the laws get tightened up, coinciding with federal law decisions."" In 1957, cops interrupted a biracial jam session at New Orleans' Preservation Hall and arrested all the musicians. The judge told an assembled courthouse crowd, according to several who were in the audience, ""We don't want Yankees coming down to New Orleans mixing cream with our coffee.""In the early Fifties, Lloyd ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" Price performed in Raleigh, North Carolina, and was delighted to see blacks and whites dancing to his songs â€“ until a white policeman stopped the music and stretched a rope down the middle of the dance floor. ""It started happening a lot,"" Price, 84, says. ""The rope was up in a lot of places. Whichever was the largest crowd, that was their dance. If it was more blacks, it'd be a black dance, and if it was more whites, it'd be a white dance.""""We experienced it in Atlanta, Georgia,"" says Sonny Turner, 78, the only surviving member of the Platters, another Hall of Fame doo-wop group, famous for ""The Great Pretender"" and ""Only You."" ""We would go out and just walk around the street and wanted to see the marquee â€“ and we were not allowed to come into the front entrance.""It wasn't just the South. Leon Hughes Sr., a member of the Coasters, remembers pulling into a scheduled show in Lincoln, Utah, anticipating a pleasant night of singing smash hits ""Young Blood"" and ""Yakety Yak."" He was climbing down from the bus when the promoter told them, ""Uh, we're looking for the Coasters band."" The group replied, ""We're the Coasters band."" The man said, ""I think they're white."" Hughes told him, ""No, we're black."" One of the men standing around panicked. ""They ain't white!"" he said. ""Let's get them out of here!"" The Coasters returned to their bus in a hurry and left town.Some artists who appeared to challenge the color line met with violence or even death. In his autobiography, bandleader and ""Willie and the Hand Jive"" hitmaker Johnny Otis, who was white, recalls watching helplessly as a musician in his group was brutally beaten for neglecting to say ""sir"" in response to a white man's question at an Augusta, Georgia, concert in 1951. The late Jackie Wilson played a 1960 package show with several top singers in Little Rock, Arkansas, and when he realized they were scheduled to play two shows, first for blacks then for whites, he pulled out of the second one. White residents brandished guns and chased Wilson's entourage out of town. One of the performers, Jesse Belvin, who had a big radio hit with ""Goodnight My Love"" and co-wrote ""Earth Angel,"" accelerated his '59 Cadillac so suddenly that his tires blew, the car swerved, and he and his wife died in the wreck.Charles Neville of the Neville Brothers recalls this harrowing story: In 1959, three young white women regularly tried to outsmart Jim Crow at the Dew Drop Inn in New Orleans. Blending into the all-black audience, they wore dark makeup and glasses, and one covered her blond hair with a bandanna. One night, when Neville and house musician Guitar Red stepped outside for a break, New Orleans police handcuffed them to a telephone pole, hauled out the women and asked, ""What the hell you doing with these niggers?"" Neville watched as the cops beat the women so badly they had to go to the hospital. ""Oh, Lord,"" he says, ""we thought they were gonna kill us.""But in the era of Elvis, Chuck and Little Richard, a curious thing started to happen: Rock &amp; roll shows became so boisterously biracial that it was sometimes impossible for officials to fully segregate them. Some recall the cops simply throwing up their hands. ""A lot of places had the line when we first walked in, and after we started playing, they let them cross the line,"" the Coasters' Hughes says. ""It was beautiful.""At the height of Jim Crow, young whites and blacks found ways to breach the separation. ""After the first intermission, the kids were all dancing together,"" Price says. ""I just kept playing my music and the kids kept comingâ€_.They were rebelling through dance, through a beat I'd createdâ€_.They start realizing we're all human."" In his authorized 1985 biography, Little Richard gives himself credit for single-handedly bringing segregated audiences together. ""We were breaking through the racial barrier,"" he wrote. Richard's producer, H.B. Barnum, recalled, ""When I first went on the road there were many segregated audiencesâ€_.And most times, before the end of the night, they would all be mixed together.""Courageous musicians, white and black, contributed to concert desegregation, which continued in some places even after it was outlawed by 1964's Civil Rights Act. In 1961, Ray Charles canceled a scheduled show in Augusta because it was at the segregated Bell Auditorium; the Beatles refused to play segregated venues on their 1965 U.S. tour. The Playboy Club in New Orleans had an integrated jazz band in the Sixties, and owner Hugh Hefner had enough money and clout to threaten legal fights against anybody who tried to stop it.These types of acts helped sway the public against Jim Crow, but ""it's perilous to think the power of Chuck Berry was somehow going to bring down segregation,"" says Ward, the Northumbria professor. It was the Civil Rights Act â€“ which, among other things, specifically prohibited discrimination in ""any motion picture house, theater, concert hall, sports arena, stadium or other place of exhibition or entertainment"" â€“ that deserves most of the credit. ""There are so many examples of the Klan loving black music, and as soon as the show was over, putting their hoods back on,"" Ward says. ""If a shared passion for certain kinds of music was the key to racial harmony, then the world would be a lot different.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,Kory Grow,2018-01-15T15:00:00.000Z,Jimi Hendrix Collaborators on Assembling Guitarist's Long-Awaited New LP,"jimi hendrix,lost jimi hendrix,both sides of the sky,jimi hendrix both sides of the sky,eddie kramer,eddie kramer jimi hendrix,eddie kramer interview,stephen stills,stephen stills jimi hendrix,stephen stills interview",Rolling Stone,"The last two years of Jimi Hendrix's life were a time of constant change. After releasing a final studio album, 1968's Electric Ladyland, the Jimi Hendrix Experience broke up, and the guitarist faced litigation over a contract he'd signed before he was famous. To fulfill the terms of the agreement, he put out the 1970 live outing&nbsp;Band of Gypsys&nbsp;with a new lineup of musicians. It would be the last LP he'd release before his death later that year, despite having stockpiled stacks of tapes for a new studio album.Much of the music he tracked in the late Sixties has come out on posthumous albums, beginning with 1971's The Cry of Love, which contained songs that Hendrix had mixed with his go-to engineer Eddie Kramer. Since the mid-Nineties, Kramer and Hendrix's estate have painstakingly trawled the vaults for previously unreleased gems. They issued the first of three compilations, Valleys of Neptune, in 2010 and followed it up with People, Hell and Angels three years later. Now they've slated&nbsp;a final volume, Both Sides of the Sky&nbsp;â€“ which highlights the many changes in Hendrix's working life as he played with different configurations of musicians between 1968 and 1970 â€“ for a March release.Beginning with ""Mannish Boy,"" a bluesy rocker that finds Hendrix singing along with his lead guitar lines, the record shows how much fun he was having at the time. In a rendition of ""Lover Man,"" a speedy tune he was fooling around with since at least 1967's Are You Experienced, he interpolates the theme from TV's Batman. And on a country-inflected take on ""Stepping Stone,"" the last single he released in his lifetime, he plays catcalls and schoolyard taunts on his guitar in between lyrics.""Imagine Jimi doing a take and when everything falls apart, he'd start playing the Batman or Peter Gunn theme without missing a beat,"" Kramer says. ""He'd do something really silly and stupid and everybody would be cracking up. He wanted to keep it light. He'd also do it to change it up a bit and inevitably those lines would work themselves into songs, and that's Jimi's sly humor.""Elsewhere, the album features Hendrix's collaborations with Johnny Winter, Lonnie Youngblood and Stephen Stills. With the latter, Hendrix played sideman on an upbeat, organ-saturated, preâ€“DÃ©jÃ  Vu rendition of Joni Mitchell's ""Woodstock."" Stills looks back fondly on the day he recorded ""Woodstock"" with Hendrix. It was late 1969, and the musicians were at the New York studio the Record Plant. At one point, Hendrix picked up a bass and they started playing the song. ""I wanted to see what would happen playing that with him,"" Stills says. ""He was just the gentlest guy. Watching him play was like watching the greatest athlete you ever saw, like Julius Irving or Muhammad Ali. It was unbelievable. He taught me to quit thinking and let it happen.""Many of the songs are alternate takes of tunes Hendrix fans already know, but they provide context and new insights into his process in his final years. ""I have had the good fortune of being able to listen to everything in the vault and I got the sense that some of these songs trace back to '67 and he was still working on them,"" co-producer John McDermott says. ""Jimi really tried to be whittling down songs, working hard to refine things. There was a constant evolution of the content.""""Jimi taught me to quit thinking and let it happen."" â€“Stephen StillsAt the time of his death, most of the recordings on Both Sides of the Sky were unfinished by Hendrix's standards. ""He probably would have revisited it and said, 'I can do that better,'"" Kramer says. ""He was never satisfied."" But he says that doesn't undersell the brilliance of the music on Both Sides. Pointing to ""Cherokee Mist"" â€“ a feedback-infused instrumental with an elastic melody that features Hendrix on sitar as well as guitar â€“ he says, ""At the very end, there's that incredible sound that he's getting out of his amplifier. It just sounds like a beast that got loose in the studio. It's primitive and wonderful.""As Hendrix would make each new recording, it would be logged and stored at his own Electric Lady Studios, which he opened in August 1970. ""Electric Lady had this enormous wall of closets, and most of them were full of tapes, and only Jimi and I had the keys,"" Kramer recalls. ""We'd say, 'Let's get this pile out and go through it.' He had these legal pads, and as we listened he would write down precisely what the instruments should be doing."" But before they could finish the album, Hendrix died while on tour in Europe that September.Even though Electric Lady was open for only a short time, Kramer has vivid memories of working on music there with Hendrix. The sessions would be like performances in and of themselves: Hendrix would be handling the faders for the guitar and vocals, and Kramer would be leaping around the console trying to keep it all together. ""After we faded down, we'd collapse laughing,"" he says. It was that experience, both having fun with Hendrix and learning what he wanted from a mix, that has provided the template for how Kramer has mixed all of Hendrix's posthumous releases. Now Both Sides of the Sky may be the last word on Hendrix in the studio. ""It is hard to say if this is it,"" McDermott says. ""With Jimi, there is always hope that there is a cache of tapes somewhere out there that would really be great. God only knows what he would have done if he had lived. He just loved to record and create.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,David Peisner,2018-01-24T14:58:00.000Z,Rhymes From the Backwoods: The Rise of Country Rap,"country-rap, hick-hop, Lactember Fest, upchurch",Rolling Stone,"Just south of Blackshear, Georgia, down a bumpy dirt road, the Moccasin Creek Off-Road Park spreads across 500 acres of wooded countryside. On a Thursday in late September, RVs, pickup trucks and trailers loaded with all manner of all-terrain vehicles wait to enter the park for the sixth annual Lactember Fest, quite possibly the world's biggest celebration of country rap. Nearly 7,000 people will make their way to this dusty patch of Southeast Georgia this weekend to ride four-wheelers through the mud, dodge fire ants, drink Bud Light and listen to live sets by artists like Bottleneck, Moonshine Bandits, Big Smo and the festival's patrons, the Lacs.The park has eight miles of backcountry trails and several mud bogs, which serve as raucous gathering spots throughout the weekend. On Saturday, with the temperature nearing triple digits, the Lacs' two MCs, Clay Sharpe and Brian King, stand at the edge of a deep circular track filled with about three feet of muddy water. More than a dozen off-road vehicles line the outside of the track, blasting a hazy mash-up of songs that's pretty typical of what the music fans here play all weekend: Brad Paisley's ""Old Alabama,"" Young Jeezy's ""Where I'm From,"" Sam Hunt's ""House Party,"" Chance the Rapper's ""No Problem,"" Young Thug's ""Best Friend,"" the Lacs' ""Kickin' Up Mud."" Sharpe, an amiable, brawny colossus in a Falcons hat and a sleeveless vest, and King, reed-thin in a loose-fitting T-shirt and jeans, watch as four-wheelers slowly circle the swampy track, with riders somehow gripping beers, cigarettes, vehicles and significant others. It's stunting, redneck-style.""People don't have a clue about this world,"" Sharpe says. ""Not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing. They just don't know this exists.""Gigs like this, at mud parks around the country, are the lifeblood of country rap. The music, sometimes called hick-hop, is pretty much the hybrid its name promises: It's rap but made largely by white guys from the rural South. Songs about jacked-up trucks, drinking, mudding and other virtues of so-called redneck life are standard, and rants extolling the virtues of the Confederate flag and the Second Amendment aren't uncommon.The complicated politics are hard to miss. The Lacs dubbed their fall tour with Big Smo and fellow country rappers Demun Jones and Shotgun Shane the ""Deplorables Tour."" The cultural appropriation on display is brazen and unapologetic. Bottleneck, a heavyset rapper from Florida, seemed to sum this up tidily with the oversize T-shirt he wore during his set Friday evening: Modeled on the classic N.W.A album Straight Outta Compton, it read, ""Straight Outta White Guilt.""Artists like the Lacs, Colt Ford, Big Smo, Upchurch and Moonshine Bandits are stars in this world, and even though they're hardly household names outside it, this isn't some tiny niche. Two different Lacs albums have gone Top Five on both Billboard's rap and country charts. Colt Ford has sold more than 1.5 million albums. Videos for these artists can top 10 million YouTube views. All this with little to no help from the mainstream music industry or traditional media outlets.As Big Smo, a beefy MC from Tennessee, puts it as we wander the Moccasin Creek campground, ""What you see here is the center of the whole country hip-hop thing. It all radiates out from places like this.""Country rap's origins can be traced pretty clearly to one guy: Bubba Sparxxx. So, early one morning in September, I drive from Atlanta to Nashville to meet with him. He doesn't show. He then spends the better portion of six weeks ignoring my calls, texts and emails, before finally calling me one afternoon.""I've been avoiding you,"" he says. Sparxxx has serious issues with the country-rap scene. ""I do urban music. I do hip-hop. I don't want to be looked at as starting anything that's not reflective of caring about hip-hop culture as much as I care about hip-hop culture.""Sparxxx was raised on a farm outside LaGrange, Georgia. ""I grew up in a racially charged environment,"" he says. ""It was pretty much 50 percent black and 50 percent white, but you didn't see mixed couples in the early Nineties. Anytime that was going on, they were sneaking around.""Sparxxx was obsessed with hip-hop and spent years as a fledgling rapper. He had real skills but no sense of what to rap about. ""It was all stuff not based in reality,"" he says. ""I was just talking about Uzis and dumb shit. I hadn't yet figured out that I needed to talk about country shit and who I really was."" When he did, in 2001, he scored a head-spinning hit with the Timbaland-produced ""Ugly,"" and seemed poised for a huge breakout. His 2003 album, Deliverance, mixed acoustic guitars, bluesy harmonica, bits of live fiddle and Timbaland's elastic beats with Sparxxx's tales of rural Georgia. It was an attempt to find common ground between the poor white people and poor black people he'd grown up around. ""My heart was always in, 'Man, these people aren't as different as they think,'"" he says. Despite positive reviews, Deliverance didn't sell. Interscope dumped Sparxxx, and most people forgot about the album. But not everyone.""Nobody was ready for Deliverance, but you see how those seeds are blooming now,"" says Derek Thrasher, who as D. Thrash is an MC and producer for country rappers the Jawga Boyz. Thrasher is part of an entire generation who grew up in the rural South in hip-hop's thrall. To guys like Thrasher, Sparxxx was a revelation. ""Bubba's the only one I heard talking about deer hunting in his lyrics. Nobody else knew about those types of things.""Sharpe and King both grew up in South Georgia. They started the Lacs â€“ which stands for Loud Ass Crackers â€“ in 2001. Nobody knew what to make of them. ""We'd go to a hip-hop club and open for Trick Daddy, then the next night we'd go in a redneck bar and open for Blake Shelton,"" says Sharpe. ""There was no avenue then."" He recalls hearing Sparxxx and being blown away. ""I was like, 'Finally somebody's giving us a voice.'""But after Deliverance failed commercially, Sparxxx moved on to the definitively urban ""Ms. New Booty,"" the biggest hit of his career, and then to rehab for a prescription drug habit. Country rap appeared dead on arrival. It took one of Sparxxx's former collaborators to jolt it back to life.Colt Ford, the son of an Athens, Georgia, car salesman, had worked with Sparxxx in a booty-shake rap duo called One Card Shi in the Nineties and also did time performing under the name X-Man, spitting Ice Cubeâ€“influenced gangsta rap while wearing a mask onstage. ""Growing up the way I did, I didn't know about that shit,"" he says, laughing. ""I was like, 'If they ever get this mask off me, they're going to fuckin' kill me!'"" He eventually realized he needed to lean on his own life experiences and in 2008 released Ride Through the Country. The album was co-produced by Shannon Houchins, a Valdosta, Georgia, native who'd also co-produced Sparxxx's debut, and it was the inaugural full-length from Houchins' and Ford's label, Average Joes Entertainment. It was country rap, but unlike Deliverance, it was aimed squarely at country audiences, with guest spots from Brantley Gilbert and Jamey Johnson. ""[Bubba] was a rapper from the country,"" says Ford. ""I'm a country boy that can rap.""The album sold well, and Jason Aldean covered one of its songs, ""Dirt Road Anthem,"" making it a Number One country hit. Soon after the album was released, Ford was offered a gig playing a South Carolina mud bog. He was used to performing in front of a few hundred fans. This time, he arrived to find nearly 5,000. Some had just shown up to ride four-wheelers but left with armloads of Colt Ford merch. ""When I got back, I was like, 'I've got to find more of these places,'"" says Houchins. An original list of 26 off-road parks grew to roughly 600.With this pipeline in place, Average Joes became a magnet for similar-minded artists, including the Lacs, Moonshine Bandits, Lenny Cooper and Charlie Farley. Outside the label, others were also taking note. Big Smo, who'd grown up on a farm in Tennessee and then spent years grinding as a protÃ©gÃ© of the Nashville street rapper Haystak, embraced his country roots, eventually signing with Warner Music Nashville and landing his own A&amp;E reality show. Other artists, like the Jawga Boyz and Bottleneck, found fertile audiences in the same world. YouTube proved a huge boost: Low-budget videos of artists living the life â€“ riding four-wheelers, ogling girls in rebel-flag bikinis, drinking moonshine, etc. â€“ spread like wildfire. And in a music industry where CD sales have been mostly relegated to a rounding error, country-rap fans still buy physical product. This is partly down to dodgy rural Internet connections and economics. ""This fan base of lower-class country folk haven't all evolved to the digital world,"" says Big Smo. ""We don't have new shit.""But as country rap has grown, it has become increasingly isolated. Although mainstream country is now heavily influenced by hip-hop â€“ not just through the occasional participation of rappers like Nelly and Ludacris, but also with artists like Sam Hunt, Jake Owen and Thomas Rhett turning to it for inspiration â€“ Nashville has shown scant interest in the country-rap movement. Radio has snubbed it. Sharpe senses institutional resistance from the country-music powers-that-be. ""A lot of radio stations are owned by rich, older males, and when you throw that word 'rap' in, older people automatically get turned off,â€ù he says. Country rap has also been largely ignored by television and the press. ""There's a lack of understanding that there's a huge audience for this,"" says Houchins.Country rap has become not so much a branch of hip-hop but simply hip-hop for rednecks. ""This is the voiceless people, the Walmart demographic,"" says Sharpe, in language that's eerily similar to exit-poll analysis on election night 2016. ""They're not heard a lot of times, but when they need to show up, they'll show up.""Of the 7,000 or so people at Lactember Fest, not all are white. When I'm walking with Big Smo, we meet a black teenager, covered in mud, riding a four-wheeler alongside a white friend. When I ask what brought him to the festival, he smiles: ""The music, the riding, the drinking, the girls."" Later, I'm introduced to a Native American metalhead with several body piercings who rode here on his motorcycle from Florida. ""People here are great,"" he tells me. ""You can't walk five feet without someone offering you a beer.""There are fewer Make America Great Again hats and Trump banners than you might expect, but even those flogging their support for the commander-in-chief aren't easy to categorize. Just before Big Smo's set on Saturday night, I share beers with a guy who lives nearby and is wearing a huge, oversize Trump mask on his head. He's a hardcore country-rap fan who has been coming to the festival for years, but also knows his hip-hop history. He loves Outkast and the Ying Yang Twins. This, as it turns out, isn't unusual. Sparxxx says most fans love mainstream hip-hop. ""In the country, they're listening to the same stuff everybody is listening to â€“ Young Dolph, Blac Youngsta, Lil Yachty.""But that sense of inclusiveness is undercut by the widespread prevalence of the Confederate flag at festivals like this. At Lactember Fest, the Lacs sell merch emblazoned with the flag and wave one onstage during a song (""Let Your Country Hang Out"") that celebrates it. Both Sharpe and King maintain a distinction between the flag and its racist legacy. ""We don't look at that flag as, 'Ha-ha, we had slaves back then,'"" says King, who worked construction before the Lacs took off. ""It's something to do with family.""I hear some version of this argument from several artists. ""It's more to do with being a poor person from the South,"" says Thrasher of the Jawga Boyz, who display a huge Confederate flag in the video for their 2013 song ""Welcome 2 Jawga."" ""Poor Southern people always feel like outcasts in this country.""Thomas Sapp, who grew up in Loganville, about an hour outside Atlanta, and raps under the name Teacher Preacher, is one of few artists of color in the country-rap scene. He also works closely with Thrasher. ""I don't put a rebel flag out there because I'm biracial,"" he says. ""Do I think it represents racism? Yeah, to some it does. But the people I've dealt with in the country-rap world who fly the rebel flag have never treated me different than they've treated anyone else. Maybe twice I've encountered somebody in this community that's bigoted. Mostly, it's completely welcoming.""Country rap isn't monolithic on the flag issue. Smo doesn't promote it. Struggle Jennings, a burly former drug dealer who also happens to be Waylon Jennings' grandson, explains that growing up in Nashville, the rebel flag ""wasn't a part of my upbringing."" In fact, although Jennings' music is, in the strictest sense, country rap â€“ in that it draws most of its inspiration from classic country and rap â€“ he's uneasy with many of the genre's totems. ""I love the country, I love the South, I've been fishing and hunting, but I'm not a hick,"" he says. ""I'm not hick-hop.""Even the Lacs are beginning to question such Confederate imagery. ""It does draw a barrier,"" says Sharpe. ""If we want to bring the music to the masses, that's a tough road to cross to get it there."" Their manager says they have stopped selling rebel-flag merch but Sharpe acknowledges that fans might see ditching the flag as a kind of selling out.There's little question that the continued prominence of the flag has made country rap a non-starter for many hip-hop fans. In September, the California-based indie rapper Murs posted a 15-minute video on HipHopDX's YouTube channel asking, ""Does Hick Hop Have a Right to Exist?"" The video garnered more than 350,000 views, and several of the country rappers I spoke to brought it up, a few not fondly. Murs' breakdown focused on his discomfort with the flag and with using an art form created by black people to promote ideas seemingly hostile to them.""I'm very pro-black and pro-hip-hop,"" he says. ""I don't take it lightly when somebody is infringing upon African-American culture. That flag became a symbol of slavery and racism. It's a flag that people who fought against the civil rights movement chose to uphold. I know the majority of Southerners weren't slave owners and that [they] got the raw end of the Industrial Revolution and a whole lot of other shit, but so did we. We've got to get rid of that flag. It's literally just a piece of fabric dividing us.""Efforts to diversify country rap have been halting but not invisible. Veteran rappers Nappy Roots played seven dates on the Deplorables Tour this fall. According to one of the group's MCs, Skinny DeVille, their first show was eye-opening. ""It was Confederate-flagâ€“crazy,"" he says. ""We were the only black guys there. I was like, 'We done fucked up. We're at a motherfucking Trump rally.' My prejudice was, Someone's gonna call us 'niggers.' We're gonna get into a fight."" DeVille's fears were unfounded. ""I couldn't have been more wrong. These people were excited to see us."" After seven shows, DeVille's conclusions about this community were heartening. ""We have so much in common. They disarmed our defensiveness and made it feel like we were one of them.""Right now, the fastest rising star in country rap is Ryan Upchurch, a talented rapper and singer who puts his controversial politics at the center of his music. Upchurch, who raps under his last name, was hanging drywall and cutting lawns until a couple of years ago when his music career started taking off. Now, he's a social-media star with more than 2.5 million Facebook followers and 500,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel, where he posts videos near-daily, opining on politics, skewering liberals and so-called social-justice warriors, and feuding with his detractors. ""I'm about to snatch you pussies up like I'm Donald Trump,"" he rapped on a 2016 track.When I meet him at his home about an hour outside Nashville, he's wearing jeans, a gray Wild Wing Cafe T-shirt and a baseball hat with a Confederate flag on it. He's built a bit like the football player he once was, with tattoos covering his thick arms, and a pinch of dip in his lower lip. He grew up not far from here, and in fact, had never even been out of Tennessee until 2015.""I didn't know what the rest of the world was like,"" he says. His parents always listened to country music but he fell in love with hip-hop around eighth grade. ""But I couldn't really relate because it had nothing to do with the lifestyle I lived."" It was a while before he discovered country rap, but once he did, he quickly grew disenchanted. ""As I got older, the more cheesy country rap sounded. Every song is about beer and trucks. I was like, 'I'm going to make it better.'""In that sense, Upchurch is working in the decades-old tradition of rappers who've incorporated politics into their music, albeit from a Fox News perspective. ""White lives, black lives and the blue matter too/So point your gun across the sea and let's just stand as a group,"" he rhymes on the title track to his 2017 album Son of the South, before continuing, ""They got people trying to kill us because of our fucking beliefs/And towelheads in the subway with a bomb in the brief."" Another song, ""Bloodshed,"" which dropped just after a white nationalist killed a counterprotester with his car at a rally to save a Confederate memorial in Charlottesville, Virginia, offers a call for political unity and the kind of rhetoric that makes such unity nearly impossible: ""American flags, Confederate flags and Nazis with swastikas/Hate groups throwing piss because they're mad at a monument.""Despite the harsh lyrics, Upchurch insists he has ""no problem with any other race or culture. Out here, we're not raised to hate. I was taught to respect everybody, no matter what color they are."" In fact, he believes he can be the one who introduces the rest of hip-hop to country rap. ""The problem with country rap is half these motherfuckers have no flavor,"" he says. ""You can't expect black culture to respect a rapper that has no flavor. There hasn't been somebody spitting so hard, talking about real-life shit, that has so much flow.""On the final night of Lactember Fest, Moonshine Bandits are performing and the crowd is gathered in a circular corral in front of the stage. Midway through their set, Dusty Dahlgren, one of the Bandits' two MCs, points into the audience. ""How many of you are proud to be from America?"" he asks. The crowd roars. ""I don't care who you voted for, him or her,"" Dahlgren continues, pausing long enough for the crowd to break into chants of â€œTrump! Trump! Trump!"" Then Dahlgren dedicates the song that follows to ""a 21-year-old named Joseph who lost his life in Afghanistan so we could be here to party."" It's called ""Pass the Ammo.""It's a weird moment that makes me think of Bubba Sparxxx's dilemma. Deliverance may have been country rap's founding text, but he's come to believe many of the album's supposed adherents missed its point. ""My goal was always to build a bridge between people,"" he says. ""It wasn't trying to say, 'Let's take this and go have our own party.' It's reflective of the split that's taken place in this country. The schism has just grown since George W. Bush got elected."" Sparxxx's career hasn't been markedly helped by his O.G status in the country-rap movement, yet he finds himself constantly pressed to speak for people he doesn't necessarily relate to. After Eminem recorded an anti-Trump freestyle in early October, Sparxxx got jabs on social media wondering whether he'd post a rebuttal. ""These jokes go around like I'm the Donald Trump of white rappers,"" he says, sighing deeply. ""I'm just like, 'Y'all motherfuckers didn't pay attention at all, did you?'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're both 90. They keep me grounded. Thelma was a principal's assistant at an elementary school. She made sure my siblings and I were properly fed, even when she was really tired. Viola worked for Rockwell International, which built the space shuttles. She and I work in the yard, paint, continuously redecorate. She bought me my first piano and made sure that if I was singing about something, it was something I knew about.What's the best advice you've ever gotten?Thelma would say, ""Don't call him. Let him call you."" That set the stakes for everything in life. Don't be desperate.â€¨ Set things in motion and then watch them happen. Let them grow.What music moves you the most?Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, Yoko Ono, John Lennon, Pink Floyd. The Dark Side of the Moon is one song all the way through. I love the production of it, the composition of it, how the drums were mixed, the time-signature changes, the vocals in ""The Great Gig in the Sky."" Everything about it is perfect.Have you ever tried playing it while watching The Wizard of Oz on mute?Of course I have. It's crazy.You have daughters ages eight and 13. What music do they listen to?They listen to pop music. They like Rihanna and Selena Gomez. [Talks to younger daughter Mars] Oh, I'm sorry. She says she hates Selena Gomez. She likes Ed Sheeran. Demi Lovato. Lil Uzi Vert.Are you familiar with those artists?Absolutely. I'm driving in the car pool listening to it. I like what's happening with music. Right now my favorite thing to listen to is the Lil Uzi Vert and Pharrell song, ""Neon Guts."" I listen to this band from Toronto called BadBadNotGood. When I go to a Young Thug or Uzi Vert or Ugly God show, what I'm seeing is a generation with something to communicate. It sounds like mumbling to you, but it sounds like vibration to me.You went through a wild-child period when you hit 40. Why then?My midlife crisis was a party. I was still doing concerts and making albums and raising my children, but I took that head wrap off. Along with the changing hormones and everything changing in the air politically and socially, I had to loosen my grip.&nbsp;What was the craziest thing you did during that time?Shit, man. I cannot tell you that, but it was definitely on my tour bus. ""This is drunk? OK. This is high? OK. This is staying out all night? OK."" I just naturally adapted. I never partied as a young girl; I was always performing or studying or doing something ""responsible."" So this was fun, real fun.What was your favorite book when you were a kid?Judy Blume's Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret. It was a collection of diary entries from a girl named Margaret. It taught me about talking about your feelings and the importance of journaling. Writing things down is powerful. I have about 70 to 80 journals at this point.Are you pessimistic or optimistic about our era?Always optimistic. I see what's happening as a rebirthing process, and labor is hard. You don't know what's going to happen. You have to wait until you are dilated to 10 before you can give birth. We at about a five right now.What's your coping mechanism?No matter how noisy it is, I try to connect to the stillness underneath every single thing. Searching for stillness gives me discipline, patience and immense compassion for people. I walk a lot, box, do tae kwon do, hot yoga. I do breathing exercises in the sauna. I jump on a trampoline with my eight-year-old, I go to dance class with my 13-year-old. Me and my son lift weights. I keep healthy people around me.&nbsp;					 				 			What's the most important rule you live by?Follow my intuition. It won't give me what I want. It'll give me what I need.â€¨You once said you'd like to direct an in-flight video.&nbsp;Is that still a dream?I don't want to think about what I got to do when the motherfucker crashes. My video would be more realistic: ""None of this shit is going to help, but if you see those masks drop, start praying and getting right with the Lord."" I would want it to be funny. At the end, I would say, ""Just think positive,"" and say a little prayer for the pilot.

""Kendrick Lamar gave me a little head nod of respect,"" he says. ""Damn, he's one of my biggest inspirations.""&nbsp;The performance was the culmination of a breakthrough year for Logic (born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II), who just five years ago was a broke rapper living on friends' couches. But last September, his hit climbed to Number Three on the Hot 100, and it has been streamed more than a half billion times on Spotify. (The song also tripled calls to the suicide prevention hotline, which it's named after.) The next step? Opening an office. He's calling from a Los Angeles comic-book store, where he's shopping for decorations. ""I want the place to look like Comic-Con,"" says Logic, an unapologetic nerd who regularly solves a Rubik's Cube onstage while rapping. He's also planning a film, set in a record store, which he will star in. ""I don't want to be tied down to one thing,"" he says. ""I'm excited to kick the world's ass."" How did you come to write a hit about suicide prevention?I spent six figures of my own money to get a tour bus and do a fan tour for my second album. I surprised fans at their houses, and we'd eat food and play video games. People kept saying, ""Your music saved my life."" I was like, ""What the fuck?"" And then I thought, ""What if I tried to save a life with a song?""Eric Cartman sang a parody of it on South Park last season. How did you feel about it?It was bittersweet. At the end of the day,&nbsp;South Park makes fun of everybody. But I wanna watch what I say: I have a sense of humor, but there are certain things that shouldn't be joked about. This is a song about suicide. They went a little far, but they're still talking about suicide, so it did shed more light on it, you know?&nbsp;What's the biggest difference between Logic and Sir Robert Bryson Hall II?The difference is Bobby has been neglected a bit. Now, after so much hard work, I get to do what I want. I'm gonna start taking trips and having fun. I've always wanted to act, so I'm making a movie. I just finished a novel and I'm excited to get it published. You can't put my talents in a box because my talents have put me in a mansion, and I'll be damned if anybody in the world can tell me what I can or cannot do because they're scared to do it themselves.Years ago, you worked at Wingstop. What'd you do there?I cleaned, took out the trash and fuckin' cut carrots and made french fries. It sucked. I used to like the boneless honey-barbecue wings, but I ate that shit so much I haven't been able to eat it for years.In 2015, you were hospitalized after having an anxiety attack. Is your anxiety under control these days?I've had much less anxiety recently because I'm coping with it. I never really dealt with depression, just severe anxiety. I've been in therapy for years. My therapist has even said, ""You don't need to be here."" I'm handling my issues head-on, not running from them.In your songs, you talk about growing up in a house with an alcoholic mother.I witnessed my brother selling crack, even to our own dad. My mom would use pills. I was like, ""I'm not going to do this."" I knew I wasn't going to beat women, even though I saw my sisters and my mom getting beaten. I knew I was going to do the opposite.""You can't put my talents in a box because my talents have put me in a mansion.""Have you let go of your anger toward your parents?I've let go because they were sick. They should have gotten help.On ""America,"" you blast Trump, adding, ""Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't."" How do you square your love for Kanye's music with his decision to support the president?To be completely honest, he has taken back the statements, apparently, so I can't really talk about that. I love Kanye. [Kanye deleted his pro-Trump tweets but never retracted his endorsement.]If you met Trump, what would you say?Nothing. There's nothing to say. And, respectfully, I'm not here to tell people who they can or can't vote for.You're a huge Star Wars fan. What did you think of the last movie?I loved it. I enjoyed Episode VII more, but I may be biased since J.J. [Abrams] is a buddy. It was cool they took time to tell a story instead of jumping around to a bunch of action.How do you feel about the decision to kill Luke Skywalker?Who is to say he's dead? Did Yoda really die? Did BenKenobi die? We learned more about the Force in this movie, and it's notsomething in a bunch of books. It's something anyone, no matter where they comefrom, can have. In many ways, I feel like Rey.

114,Elias Leight,2018-01-26T14:55:00.000Z,Superdrummer Chris Dave on Why He Needed to Make His Own Album,"chris dave, chris dave drums, chris dave drumhedz, drumhedz, chris dave album",Rolling Stone,"Chris Dave has drummed on some of the most popular and most acclaimed albums of the past decade, including Adele's 21 and D'Angelo's Black Messiah. But instrumental prowess rarely comes with the same cultural clout as singing, producing or even composing. ""If you play drums, that's what people look at you as â€“ just the drummer,"" Dave says. ""I don't want to be everyone's drummer until I die. I want to have some kind of statement. It was always a matter of figuring out how, when, where."" After recording for years, in between tours and session work, with like-minded instrumentalists and singers â€“ including players and the recording engineer from Black Messiah, 2016 breakout star Anderson. Paak, and veteran R&amp;B acts Bilal, Tweet and Mint Condition singer Stokley Williams â€“ the 44-year-old artist finally has his manifesto: Chris Dave and the Drumhedz, an elegant romp through lurching funk, slow-burning soul, throwback hip-hop and fleet Afrobeat.  The range of styles reflects Dave's 25-yearâ€“plus career, during which he has recorded with or played behind most of the great musicians in modern R&amp;B, along with many in rap, gospel and jazz. He took up drums and piano in church as a child and continued his studies at Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, the same institution that nurtured BeyoncÃ© and the jazz pianist Robert Glasper. By the time he was a student at Howard University in Washington, D.C., Dave was touring with Daniel Winans, a member of one of gospel's royal families. During Dave's sophomore year, he auditioned for the Minneapolis funk band Mint Condition and landed a gig as the group's touring drummer. Dave has maintained a hectic schedule ever since, working with Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu, Meshell Ndegeocello, Glasper, Ed Sheeran and others. Along the way, he's impressed more than his fair share of musical luminaries. Speaking with Rolling Stone in 2016, Maxwell credited Dave for introducing him to the musicians who played on the Grammy-winning BLACKsummers'night, which featured Dave on percussion and fellow Drumhed Keyon Harrold on trumpet. ""At that very fragile, delicate time in my career, who knew what was going to happen, if [my music] was going to be relevant to people or not?"" the singer added. ""Those guys made it relevant.""Other members of Dave's fan club include Rick Rubin, who convinced him to become the studio drummer at Shangri La Studios, and Don Was, who signed Dave to Blue Note Records. Rubin asked to meet with Dave after seeing him play behind Mos Def on The Late Show With David Letterman. ""His understanding of groove, feel and emotion is unparalleled,"" says Rubin, who has produced everything from early Def Jam singles to Slayer albums and Adele cuts. Like Rubin, Was caught Dave live â€“ playing with Glasper around the time the two men were working on Black Radio â€“ and was enthralled. ""He totally fucked me up,"" says Was, a veteran bassist and producer. ""There's an incredible originality and sophistication to where he chooses to play and where he chooses to leave space. It's like a fingerprint â€“ there's no one who approaches drums like he does.""But originals don't always have the opportunity to be original, which is part of why Dave felt compelled to carve out space for Chris Dave and the Drumhedz. This is his personal playground, where lustrous R&amp;B ballads like ""Cosmic Intercourse,"" which features vocals from Stokley Williams, sit next to the head-nod workout ""Destiny n Stereo"" and ""Atlanta, Texas,"" a spoken-word treatise on the power of rhythm. ""Job Well Done,"" a duet between rising singers Anna Wise and SiR, reaches towards swooning late Seventies cuts like Delegation's ""Oh Honey""; it's almost washed away by the next song, a hard-jab number titled ""Lady Jane.""Dave used multiple drum sets while recording ""Lady Jane,"" one of several strategies he employed on Chris Dave and the Drumhedz to keep the sound of the percussion alluringly off-kilter. ""It was supposed to be a jazz album,"" he says, ""but I was like, I'm not even gonna have a jazz drum set on this record."" He advises listeners to return to the record ""more than once, so you can hear the little things with the drums you didn't hear the first time"": the introduction of a rifle-shot snare â€“ Dave is a snare-drum collector and famous for using snares where another drummer might use tom-toms â€“ and fine mist of cymbals that split up ""Sensitive Granite,"" or the distinctive, hissing smack that guides the listener through all the heroic riffing in ""Lady Jane.""&nbsp;Everything on the album was done live, which still surprises Was. ""The way he is able to emulate the jagged J Dilla beats â€“ humans aren't supposed to play that stuff,"" the Blue Note boss says. ""I couldn't believe it wasn't a loop.""Dave sees the album as an antidote to the stifling risk aversion that characterizes some major-label projects. ""Artists wants to do stuff that maybe the label doesn't want them to try,"" he explains. ""'Would they ever let you sing something like this on your project?' Most artists are like, 'Fuck, no.' We're like, 'Let's do that one.'"" Take ""Spread Her Wings,"" another rippling duet between Bilal and Tweet. ""There's no smooth Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrellâ€“type shit [today],"" Dave says. ""I always wanted a song with Bilal and Tweet; I just wanted to do it our way.""""The project was to show that drummers can write, produce and arrange,"" Dave continues. ""It's for all the unsung musicians: You can do whatever the fuck you want to.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,Andy Greene,2018-01-31T16:32:00.000Z,Inside the Stunning Resurrection of Michael Nesmith's First National Band,"Michael Nesmith, First National Band, Michael Nesmith First National Band",Rolling Stone,"Michael Nesmith couldn't believe what he was seeing when he walked onstage at the San Bernardino, California, club Pappy &amp; Harriet's Palace earlier this month. It was his first gig with his early-Seventies country-rock group the First National Band since they split 46 years ago amid raging public disinterest, yet here was a capacity crowd euphorically singing along to songs drawn from a trio of albums that never went higher than Number 143 on the Billboard album chart.""This is something I've dreamed about, but it's never actually happened to me,"" says Nesmith. ""The audience, before I start singing each song, began singing them back to me. Usually I just get ignored and nobody plays attention to me. On this tour, audiences have actually been weeping and saying, 'This is the greatest music that never got heard.' It's getting me verklempt.""Of course, playing to rapturous audiences is nothing new to Michael Nesmith. As the Monkee in the green wool hat, he performed for throngs of shrieking teenage fans in the 1960s. In recent years, he's periodically toured with his surviving bandmates Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork. But to him, playing with the First National Band is a wildly different experience. ""It's qualitatively different because Monkees crowds are there because of the television show,"" he says. ""They are remembering that time that we did this funny thing in the haunted house with the hillbillies and Mr. Schneider. This is pure, unadulterated, romantic and spiritual love that happens when great music is sung. And I never expected it. Not in my life.""Nesmith formed the First National Band right around the time he walked away from the Monkees in 1970. Working with pedal-steel guitarist O.J. Rhodes, bassist John London and drummer John Ware, he fused country and rock in a way that had never been heard before. ""It was an amalgam of something that happened in the countercultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s,"" he says, ""between television and phonograph records, live bands and live studio acts."" Lead single ""Joanne"" reached Number 21 on the Hot 100, but the band's debut, 1970's&nbsp;Magnetic South, was a complete bomb. Follow-up efforts Loose Salute and Nevada Fighter did no better and the group split just two years after it all began.It was a crushing experience for Nesmith, especially since he started the group with stratospheric dreams. ""I wanted it to be was one of the great bands in the world playing some of the great music in the world with some of the great people in the world,"" he says. ""Nothing less than that. I thought, 'Well, why can't I play stadiums with the First National Band?'""The agony grew worse just months after they split when Linda Ronstadt's live backing band named themselves the Eagles and began landing massive radio hits with country-rock songs like ""Take It Easy"" and ""Peaceful Easy Feeling."" ""I was heartbroken beyond speech,"" says Nesmith. ""I couldn't even utter the words 'the Eagles' and I loved Hotel California and I love the Eagles, the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo, all that stuff. That was right in my wheelhouse and I was agonized, Van Goghâ€“agonized, not to compare myself to him, but I wanted to cut something off because I was like, 'Why is this happening?' The Eagles now have the biggest selling album of all time and mine is sitting in the closet of a closed record company?""Through the rest of 1970s he continued to record solo albums that were somehow even less popular than his First National Band work â€“ including the ironically titled And the Hits Just Keep on Comin' â€“&nbsp;but his attention gradually turned toward business ventures. (His mother invented Liquid Paper and left him a substantial fortune when she passed away in 1980.) A 1996 Monkees reunion fizzled out after a brief U.K. tour, but in 2012 he returned to the band for a series of highly successful tours. He eventually left the touring unit, but he participated in the group's 2016 comeback album Good Times! That year, he played with the group at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles at a show that was billed as his final appearance with the band.Around that time, urged on by his sons Christian and Jonathan along with some California-based concert promoters, he began thinking about resurrecting the First National Band. Despite selling virtually no records, the group slowly developed a passionate, cult following over the years as fans stumbled upon the old albums.&nbsp; A legitimate reunion was out of the question since Rhodes and London have passed away and Ware, at age 73, told Nesmith that he's simply too old to go back on the road. That allowed Christian Nesmith â€“ an accomplished musician in his own right, who was recently part of the Monkees' touring band â€“ to assemble a new lineup of the First National Band that includes bassist Jason Chesney, pedal-steel guitarist Pete Finney, drummer Christopher Allis, and vocalists Amy Spear and Circe Link. Christian Nesmith plays guitar and Jonathan Nesmith is on piano, guitar and vocals.Completely unsure if there was an audience, they put a single show at the 500-seat Troubadour on sale and watched in amazement when it sold out in 42 minutes. ""That sent a shockwave through the promotion company,"" says Nesmith. Four dates were added at clubs around California, which wrapped up January 28th at the the Chapel in San Francisco with special guest Ben Gibbard. The set list focuses on songs from the three First National Band albums but also features later tunes like 1977's ""Rio"" along with ""Different Drum,"" a tune Nesmith wrote right before he joined the Monkees in 1965 that Linda Ronstadt turned into a big hit. There are no firm plans for other shows, but Nesmith says they are seriously looking into playing at least a few more gigs in markets outside California sometime later this year.The only Monkees song in the First National Band repertoire is ""Papa Gene's Blues,"" but that doesn't mean Nesmith has completely turned his back on his original band. He's deep into talks with promoters about a summer tour where he'd share the stage with Micky Dolenz. ""Mick is a great performer,"" says Nesmith. ""I love working with him. He's a wonderful guy. So the idea of us going out and doing something under the banner of the Monkees is under discussion. The agents are standing there with a stack of offers. I think they are running through June, but we have not accepted anything.""If such a tour does happen, it won't mean, at least to Nesmith, that he's going back on his 2016 pledge that Monkee Michael walked offstage forever at the 2016 Pantages Theater show. ""This isn't Monkee Michael and Monkee Micky going out,"" he says. ""If we go out on another tour and we do it and use the Monkees logo and name promote it, it will be very different than a Monkees show. I mean, it'll be Monkees music, but there's no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees. We're not. We're the remnants, but we'll have a good time if we do it.""This proposed tour begs a very obvious question: Why isn't Peter Tork involved? Nez picked his words very carefully when we posed this to him. ""Well, you'd have to ask Peter,"" he says. ""I'm afraid I would betray a confidence if I said any more than, 'This is not a right time for him.' I don't think it would untoward for you to give him a call and just launch the question. He has his reasons. They are very private. If he's willing to share them with you, so be it.""We reached out to Peter Tork and got this response via email: ""Nez's comment sounds oddly worded,"" he wrote. ""Although he and I have not been in touch for more than a year (which is not unusual in our history), I have in general made no secret of the fact that all these recent years of Monkees-related projects, as fun as theyâ€™ve been, have taken up a lot of my time and energy. Moving forward I have blues projects that I want to give my attention to and&nbsp;focused on putting together some shows with my band, Shoe Suede Blues in support of our new CD Relax Your Mind, a Lead Belly tribute project that's very dear to my heart. So, Iâ€™m shifting gears for now, but I wish the boys well, and Iâ€™ve learned to never say never on things further down the line.""Whatever happens going forward, right now Nez is focused on the future of the First National Band and figuring out exactly why it's suddenly become so popular. ""Dare I say it became hipster music?"" he asked. ""No. I don't say that. But dare I say that it's music whose time has come? I'm pretty confident in saying something like that. I never thought it would happen.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,Stuart Miller,2017-12-10T14:00:00.000Z,Inside Otis Redding's Final Masterpiece '(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay',"otis redding, dock of the bay, sittin on the dock of the bay, otis redding death, otis redding dock of the bay, otis redding sittin on the dock of the bay, steve cropper, otis redding steve cropper",Rolling Stone,"When the phone rang at the Stax/Volt studios in Memphis in late November of 1967, guitarist Steve Cropper was surprised to hear Otis Redding on the other end, calling from the airport. ""Usually Otis would check into the Holiday Inn or whatever hotel he was staying at and then he'd call for me to come over and do some writing,"" Cropper recalls. But this time Redding was too excited to wait. ""I've got a hit,"" he told Cropper, so he wanted to come straight to the studio to flesh his idea out into a full-fledged song. Redding was right. When ""(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay"" was released less than two months later, it became the singer's first million-seller and first Billboard Number One single. But the legendary soul singer never got to hear the finished version of his breakthrough single: He had died in a plane crash on December 10th. Redding laid down numerous tracks in his final weeks, none more important than ""Dock of the Bay."" The roots of the song trace back to June of that year. In the middle of the month, Redding, backed by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s, left the largely white crowd at the Monterey Pop Festival awestruck, making an impression rivaled only by the Who and Jimi Hendrix. Redding had won over white audiences in Los Angeles at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub the previous year and in Europe that spring, where his admirers included four guys from Liverpool taking a break from recording their new album. But Monterey Pop was on a different scale, and the unabashed adulation confirmed for Redding that he could cross over to become a major star.""Monterey had a powerful effect on Otis,"" recalls Stanley Booth, who interviewed Redding for the&nbsp;Saturday Evening Post&nbsp;during those final sessions. ""He saw a huge crowd of white kids going nuts over him, and he began to believe he could follow in the footsteps of Sam Cooke and Ray Charles.""Al Bell, then a Stax executive, says that he told Redding he was getting pegged as a genre musician and ""would have to come up with something different. We talked back and forth on it. I suggested he write something folk-like, saying we could call it Soul Folk. It was the only time I told Otis what to do.""Redding had begun listening to Bob Dylan, whom he'd met at the Whisky in '66 but beginning in June, the singer â€“ like the rest of the world â€“ was playing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band over and over. The Beatles' album got Redding thinking. He had always relied on the emotion and energy in his vocals to carry his songs, but now he started paying more mind to the words themselves; he'd also recorded most of his songs live in the studio, but the complex layering achieved by the Beatles and George Martin clued him in to other ways of building tracks. Redding had produced (and co-written) Arthur Conley's hit ""Sweet Soul Music"" earlier that year and Cropper says he started talking about getting off the road and spending more time producing in the studio. ""Absolutely his style was changing,"" Cropper tells Rolling Stone. ""One of the main things Otis told me in the car one day was, 'I'm coming to Memphis and I'm going to get a place and you and I are going to produce and write songs.' He really enjoyed being in the studio.""Still, Redding was committed to the road for the rest of that summer, including a six-night gig at Basin Street West in San Francisco in August. When rock impresario Bill Graham made him an offer to get out of downtown, Redding, a country boy at heart, was happy to spend those days on Graham's houseboat. It's here where Redding began writing the song â€“ and where the first of the myths and misconceptions about it began. Marc Myers, in his book Anatomy of a Song: The Oral History of 45 Iconic Hits that Changed Rock, R&amp;B and Pop, mistakenly noted that Redding went to the houseboat to catch his breath right after playing Monterey. Meanwhile, the city of San Francisco recently put the lyrics on display on a pier in Brannan Street Wharf. But Redding was more than 10 miles away, at Waldo Point Harbor in Sausalito.&nbsp;Redding's Wikipedia page mistakenly claims that the song ""was written with Cropper while they were staying with their friend, Earl 'Speedo' Simms, on a houseboat in Sausalito."" But while Simms, Redding's road manager, was there, Cropper was thousands of miles away.&nbsp;The fact that Cropper wasn't there is obvious in his reaction to the song â€“ that fall, when Redding first sang him the lines ""Watching the ships roll in/And then I watch 'em roll away again,"" Cropper says he ""always envisioned a ship going under the Golden Gate Bridge.""""Me being a purist kind of guy I said, 'Otis, did you ever think that if a ship rolls it's going to take on water and sink,'"" Cropper recalls, ""and he said about the lyric, 'Hell, Crop, that's what I want,' and Otis always got his way.""Actually, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't even visible from where Redding was, but Cropper never saw that spot until years later when he was on tour with Robert Cray; he got a bite to eat overlooking the water and saw ferries going back and forth and realized that ""when a ferry goes to park it pushes up a big wake and comes in sideways and looks like it is rolling in. So a ferry was a ship in his mind.""On the bright side, Cropper's misunderstanding about the location led him to add the lines, ""I left my home in Georgia [Redding grew up in Macon], heading for the Frisco Bay,"" which works much better than ""heading for Richardson Bay,"" where Redding and the dock were. (Cropper says that years later Neil Young told him he stayed in Graham's houseboat the week after Redding.)Redding didn't have much more than the basic chords and his first verse about sitting and watching the ships, and the chorus. And then he put the song aside for a while. ""That was Otis,"" Cropper says. ""He always carried his guitar with him, but not in the case, and he'd have an idea and just start writing â€“ he always had 14 or 15 ideas in his head, totally unfinished.""Redding stopped touring that fall when polyps on his vocal cords required surgery, sidelining and even nearly silencing him at first. He had to communicate by writing notes, though he also wrote more songs. By late November, he was turned loose and Cropper says his voice sounded better than ever. He recorded more than 30 new songs in a burst of creativity at the end of that month and the beginning of December. Most would end up on posthumous releases including ""Hard to Handle,"" ""The Happy Song"" and ""I've Got Dreams to Remember,"" which he wrote based on a poem by his wife Zelma. Some, like ""I'm a Changed Man,"" reflect the new emphasis on lyrics, while others, though still recognizably soul songs,  feature more of Cropper's guitar and hint at a move toward rock. ""Otis was a hard worker and he grew as an artist with each record,"" Stax co-founder Jim Stewart tells RS. ""Each time he came in he took more and more responsibility and more control of his sessions. The musicians respected him and loved him. He really lit up the studio when he was there.""That desire for more control and responsibility had actually led Redding to chafe at some of Stewart's decisions. Some biographers say Redding was considering entering into a partnership with Atlantic, feeling he'd need a new home as he looked to expand his sound and his audience, instead of being sent out to headline yet another tour.""Stewart and Stax were somewhat limiting musically and Stewart was opposed to changes,"" says keyboardist Booker T. Jones. He adds, though, that if Redding had firm plans, he ""kept them to himself.""""I was in somewhat the same place after the Europe tour and Monterey,"" Jones continues. ""We hung with rock stars and I was headed away from Memphis. I felt restricted at Stax. I was heading to California.""There is debate about when Redding and Cropper wrote ""Dock of the Bay"" and when it was recorded. Rob Bowman, author of Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records, says he found the American Federation of Musicians session sheet for ""Dock of the Bay"" in the files of Fantasy Records, which bought Stax in the 1970s and that it places the recording session as November 22nd, the day before Thanksgiving. Tim Sampson, communications director for the Soulsville Foundation, which runs the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, trusts Bowman's research, and suggests that this sheet may be the most reliable source available.That date fits with the idea of an excited Redding calling Cropper about his new song from the airport the day before the session started and it also allows enough time for Redding and his band to lay down all those new tracks. Cropper isn't certain of the date but remembers recording the song ""a week to 10 days"" before he laid down his electric guitar part on December 8th, which puts the recording (if not the writing) at the tail end of November. In his article, Booth describes Cropper and Redding writing the song closer to that time period, although now he says it may have transpired during the final week of Redding's life.Jonathan Gould, author of Otis Redding: An Unfinished Life, claimed Redding recorded the song over two sessions, finishing on December 8th, but Cropper says that while he added his electric guitar part on that day and played it for Redding, the singer was already done with his vocals. In Mark Ribowsky's book, Dreams to Remember, he cited that the Atlantic session logs give the recording date as December 7th. But he also mistakenly identifies that as a Wednesday (not a Thursday) and writes that the log says the band included Cropper, drummer Al Jackson, organist Booker T. Washington (rather than Booker T. Jones), bassist Donald ""Duck"" Dunn, trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Joe Arnold. Arnold told Rolling Stone he definitely was not on that song; the sax part was actually played by Wayne Jackson's Memphis Horns partner Andrew Love. Rolling Stone learned that two more horn players â€“ Mickey Gregory and Tommy Lee Williams â€“ dubbed additional parts on the track on Friday December 8th. Gregory says they were not in the union so Cropper paid them cash. Gregory also recalls hitting up Redding for a loan. ""Otis said he just gave away $200, but he gave me his last 20,"" he says.""The Atlantic log book is riddled with errors,"" Bowman says in an email, explaining that ""most of the Stax entries in that book are the dates when Atlantic received the final tapes from Stax, not when the sessions actually occurred,"" although in this case Atlantic did not receive the tapes until December 13th. (Some books and articles say Redding recorded the song on the same day he and Cropper wrote it, but this may be based on a misreading of Booth's narrative article; both Cropper and Booth insist they were two discrete events.)As for the writing of the song, Cropper says he and Redding were alone in the studio when they wrote the song â€“ Redding said, ""Crop, get your gut-tar,"" as he pronounced it, and they got right to work. But Booth says he was there too. He had just interviewed Al Jackson when Redding pulled up in his limo. Booth says he went inside with Redding and watched as he and Cropper hammered out the song.Booth's story describes the musicians ""sitting on folding chairs, facing each other, in the dark cavern-like grey-and-pink studio"" and depicts Redding playing his ""bright red dime-store guitar strumming simple bar chords"" and that ""the front of the guitar is cracked as if someone has stepped on it."" (Cropper explains that Redding always kept his acoustic open tuned to an E chord so he could easily play major chords.)Most stories credit Cropper with the ""Frisco Bay"" line while Booth's original narrative reported Redding coming up with it.Cropper came up with the chords for the bridge, which also changed the song's tempo. ""It was a thing I had in my head, real simple â€“ 1, 5, 4; 1, 5, 4; 1, 5, 4, 1; 6, 7, 5 â€“ and Otis just kind of ad-libbed those lyrics. It felt good and we kept it.""Redding did make one change in the recording session: on take one, he sings that he ""can't do what 20 people tell me to do,"" before halving that number for the second and third takes.""We didn't put stuff down when we were writing, we just put it in our head,"" Cropper says.On whatever day it was that the band recorded, Cropper played a Gibson acoustic rhythm guitar, which he describes as a ""country western flat-top round-hole guitar."" He strummed the chords until Dunn found a bass groove and then Al Jackson kicked in with his part.Jones says he ""tried giving the piano parts a marine feeling, building on fourths."" Then Redding and Cropper created horn parts for Love and Wayne Jackson by singing the notes they wanted. At the end of the first take, Redding started whistling, poorly enough that engineer Ron Capone joked that he wasn't ""going to make it as a whistler."" Redding nailed it on the third take.The whistling has been the subject of much debate. Cropper says that he always left space at the end of a song for Redding to add extra vocals, frequently ad-libbed on the spot. On this day, Cropper says, Redding simply forgot what he wanted to sing and whistled instead, merely as a placeholder to be fixed at a later date. ""If he had come back that Monday, it would definitely have been different,"" Cropper says. While Redding and Cropper planned more work on the song, the fact that Redding whistled on all three takes gave many the impression that this was an intentional touch that perfectly suited the song's mood.""That was no placeholder,"" says Al Bell. ""That was Otis â€“ the very essence coming out of him.""Later, a rumor began swirling that Redding's whistling wasn't good enough and that Cropper used musician Sam ""Bluzman"" Taylor to dub in a stronger take. Cropper vehemently denies that. ""I don't even know where that story came from,"" he says. While ""Dock of the Bay"" is now hailed as an influential classic â€“ placing at number 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time â€“ the initial reaction to the song was mixed. Cropper says he played the song for Zelma Redding and Johnny Lee ""Blue Moon"" Odom, the major-league pitcher who hailed from Redding's hometown of Macon, Georgia, and was hanging out during some of those sessions. Zelma Redding didn't like the new approach. She reportedly felt his post-surgery songs were too strongly Beatles-influenced and has been quoted as saying that her husband told her, ""Boy, when I go back out there, I'm gonna be the new Otis Redding,"" to which she replied with a hint of dismay, ""Oh, God, you are changing."" Redding responded, ""It's time for me to change in my music.""Cropper and Jones loved the tune, but Dunn was unimpressed. ""It has no R&amp;B whatsoever,"" the late bassist said in interviews, adding that he thought it ""might even be detrimental"" to Redding's career. Redding's manager Phil Walden thought it was ""too pop"" and Jim Stewart didn't love it either. Jones believes Redding would not have been deterred. ""It wasn't consequential what they thought,"" he says. ""Otis was determined to do what he was going to do.""Redding did brush off their concerns with a confident aura, telling Walden, ""This is my first million-seller,"" but it seems the doubters did get to him somewhat. On Friday, December 8th, he had lunch with labelmates David Porter and William Bell; Bell says they ate at the Four Way, a popular Memphis restaurant, and then went back to Stax to listen to the preliminary mix. Without the masterful touches Cropper would later add, the drums and the horns are more prominent, undermining the song's wistful vibe.  ""I think he was just a little bit unsure of himself and how it would turn out,"" William Bell says, adding that he loved the song in part because it was different. ""He wanted confirmation from all of us."" The same day, on December 8th, Cropper laid down the electric-guitar track, using his Fender Esquire that he has since donated to the Smithsonian Museum. ""The last time I saw Otis, I was setting up with my guitar in the control room. I'd face the amp away from the speakers so I wouldn't get any crosstalk or feedback. Otis popped his head in and said, 'I'll see you Monday.'""Booth now tells a story that doesn't jibe with the facts, writing in an email, ""The day after the song was recorded, I went in the control room, where it was being played back.  All of a sudden there were seagulls on it!  'Steve,' I said, 'Where'd you get them birds?' He gave me a blank look.  'Sound effects,' he said."" But Cropper says he hadn't yet even conceived of adding the sound of birds and waves that now feel so intrinsic to the song. Instead, he says, he and Redding felt the track was missing some special something and had a plan to give ""Dock of the Bay"" a more traditional soul feel. Cropper suggested background vocals and told Redding that the Staple Singers were coming in shortly, adding that ""I know if I asked them they'd be more than happy to sing on the song. Otis said it was a great idea. He planned on being there."" Two days later, Redding was dead. Unwilling to no-show for a gig, he boarded his small plane for Madison, Wisconsin, from Ohio. The plane plunged into a lake near Madison, killing the pilot, Redding and his entire road band except trumpeter Ben Cauley.Unfortunately for Cropper, a tragic death meant a business opportunity for the record labels. Redding died on Sunday and on Monday, according to Cropper, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler called Jim Stewart demanding a new song. ""Jim asked, 'What do you have ready,' but I said, 'I don't have anything mixed,'"" Cropper remembers.So, on Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m. he entered the studio, devoting the next 24 hours to finishing ""Dock of the Bay."" ""One of the hardest things I ever had to do was mix that song,"" says Cropper. There was no time for background vocals but Cropper knew the song ""really needed something."" ""I got to thinking about Otis clowning around on some of the outtakes.  He was trying to make seagull sounds but he sounded like a dying crow.""As homage to his friend and partner, Cropper went to a local jingle company and recorded an extended loop of seagulls and ocean waves on separate tracks. He then used trial-and-error to figure out where to bring the sounds up in the song.""I stayed up 24 hours mixing the song. The next morning I went out to the airport, went out on the tarmac and a stewardess came down to the bottom of the steps and I handed her that master,"" Cropper recalls. The tape was flown to New York and disc jockeys had preview  copies in their hands by Christmas. A story has circulated in books like Gould's that Wexler sent the tape back demanding the vocals be mixed higher â€“ this was a constant source of friction between Atlantic and Stax executives â€“ and that the change was made. That never happened, Stewart says. ""It was released in its original form.""""No way I could have mustered up the energy to mix that record again,"" Cropper says, adding that Wexler often took credit for the remix but that the executive may have later listened to the mono version created for a posthumous album, which would have naturally brought the vocals higher, and thought he had gotten his way.The song was released on January 8th, 1968. Redding's death certainly fueled interest, but the song's lyrics spoke to every working man who wanted to get away from the bosses and just relax a little. Those lyrics also resonated powerfully with soldiers in Vietnam, according to&nbsp;Doug Bradley and Craig Werner's&nbsp;We Gotta Get Out of This Place: The Soundtrack of the Vietnam War.The single topped the charts on March 16th and eventually sold more than 2 million copies. ""I remember giving the gold record to Zelma in a presentation,"" Stewart says. ""But I kept thinking about how Otis never got to experience this.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,Andy Greene,2018-01-25T16:16:00.000Z,MGMT's Pop Adventure: How Duo Bounced Back 11 Years After Debut,"MGM, Little Dark Age, Little Dark Age interview",Rolling Stone,"MGMT know exactly how the world feels about everything they've done since their breakthrough 2007 debut LP, Oracular Spectacular. The psychedelic synth-pop duo â€“ who met at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and crafted their early hits ""Kids,"" ""Electric Feel"" and ""Time to Pretend"" in their dorm rooms â€“ became indie darlings in the late aughts. But they alienated fans, critics and even their record label by releasing two disappointing experimental albums, 2010's Congratulations and 2013's MGMT. ""A lot of people wrote us off after the third record,"" says frontman Andrew VanWyngarden. ""They were like, 'Oh, they have no pop juice left in them. It's not happening again.'""The two briefly felt that way themselves, so they decided to take some time off. Keyboardist Ben Goldwasser moved to L.A. with his fiancee, and VanWyngarden bought a house in Rockaway Beach, Queens, where he created a home studio and surfed. The duo, who'd previously crafted songs out of extended jams, learned to work via e-mail. ""The geographical separation was a big influence on the music,"" says Goldwasser. ""We really had to focus when we actually got together.""When they finally got back in the same room to create their next album, producer Patrick Wimberly (Solange, Blood Orange) urged them to focus on the basics of songwriting. ""It clicked back to the way we used to write in college, where we were thinking in terms of verses and choruses,"" says VanWyngarden. ""We weren't trying to mask our pop influences like Talking Heads, Hall and Oates, and the 1980s music our parents would listen to and we still liked. It felt good to get back to that.""  The result is Little Dark Age, by far their poppiest release since Oracular Spectacular, full&nbsp;of accessible hooks and often hilarious lyrics. Opening track â€œShe Works Out Too Muchâ€ù is a jab at someone who uses social media to create the illusion of a perfect life (""Sick of liking your selfies/Shouldâ€™ve gone with my gut""), and ""TSLAMP"" is short for ""Time Spent Looking at My Phone."" ""That one is me lamenting my entire existence,"" says VanWyngarden, ""while combining a 1980s electro beat with Madonna's 'La Isla Bonita' and a Margo Guryan chorus. I hope somebody reviews the song like that.""Half of the album was written before Donald Trump's surprise victory in the 2016 election. ""We were like, 'Wow, is it actually possible for the most impossible thing to happen?"" recalls VanWyngarden ""But it was actually our reality."" In the immediate aftermath, bizarrely, they wrote some of the album's most chipper songs, including ""Me and Michael"" and ""Little Dark Age. ""Apparently,"" says VanWyngarden, ""we were more inspired to write pop music after evil took over the world.""""James"" is a tribute to their close friend James Richardson, the guitarist in their live band. ""Iâ€™m always home,"" VanWyngarden sings, ""walk on in Iâ€™ll make you tea and breakfast."" ""Me and Michael"" also comes off as an ode to a buddy, but they aren't willing to get into any details about the inspiration. ""That's for you to find out,"" says VanWyngarden. ""And for me to find out.""The album wraps with ""Hand It Over,"" and there's nothing remotely cryptic about the meaning of lines like ""the joke's worn thin/the king stepped in."" ""That's pretty much directly about Donald Trump becoming president,"" says VanWyngarden. And despite the occasional sad joke or negative vibe, they insist the album is largely positive. ""We called it Little Dark Age because that's hopeful,"" says VanWyngarden. ""It's a little dark age. And we ended the album with 'Hand it Over' because it envisions an end to all of this.""At no point along the way did they think they were writing music that would play on Top 40 radio. ""Radio never enters the equation for us,"" says Goldwasser. ""It's so rare that I even turn on the radio and hear a run of new music that I like. I just know that everything I hear is going to suck. The label likes 'Me and Michael' the most. But I think the simplicity of that is what has pop appeal more than any intention we had while making it.""MGMT handed the album to Columbia Records last April, but they were told it wouldn't come out until February. Now, they have only one more record left in their contract, and are excited about the possibilities of label-less freedom. â€œI would love to just go straight from fucking around in my attic to putting something on YouTube,â€ù says VanWyngarden. Goldwasser has an even bolder vision: ""Maybe instead of putting out an album, we'll put out an immersive art installation where you go into a house and each room is a different musical landscape. We can enter the David Byrne era of our career.""Last year marked the ten-year anniversary of Oracular Spectacular, which they could have easily used as an excuse to release a deluxe version of the LP, and play it straight through on tour. ""I wanted to do stuff like that,"" reveals VanWyngarden. ""But our managers advised us against it for some reason."" Goldwasser was relieved when it didn't happen. ""I'm glad we didn't make a big deal out of it,"" he says. ""I don't know how you're supposed to feel ten years after putting out a successful album. Maybe you are supposed to go on a ten year anniversary tour. I don't know.""""Right now, they are focusing their energies on their tour, which hits U.S. theaters in late March. They removed ""Kids"" from their setlist on the early legs of their 2013 tour, causing some fans to get the wrong idea about they feel about their breakthrough song. ""That got blown out of proportion,"" says VanWyngarden. ""I would say that at over 90 percent of our shows we have played 'Kids.' We'll always play our most popular songs. If I'm going to see a band, the last thing I want to hear is their newest thing.""That said, the constant focus on their early work can be irritating for a group so focused on moving forward. ""There's no article or video or anything about us that doesn't mention the first album and those three songs,"" says VanWyngarden. ""It's ridiculous. But ultimately, I feel like we're both grateful for it. Even though people mention that every time, they're still talking about us. Lots of bands, they just disappear or their label drops them. We're lucky in the sense that we still have a career ten years on after giving people all this experimental stuff.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,David Fricke,2017-11-21T16:25:48.392Z,"Don Henley Talks 'Hotel California' Reissue, Eagles' Future","eagles, hotel california, don henley, don henley interview, deacon frey, glenn frey, vince gill eagles, eagles grand ole opry, don felder, eagles rolling stone",Rolling Stone,"""I was delighted at the energy and grittiness of the live tracks,"" Eagles singer-drummer Don Henley says of the previously unissued concert recordings â€“ from October 1976 at the Forum in Los Angeles â€“ added to the new 40th-anniversary reissue of the band's fifth studio album and biggest seller, Hotel California. ""We're a year late, technically speaking,"" Henley admits, noting the LP's original release in December 1976. ""But we had enough foresight to record those shows. I was surprised that we were doing songs from the album before it even came out. That was pretty ballsy.""     Henley is speaking the day after a milestone in Eagles' touring life: their October 29th debut performance at Nashville's country-radio landmark, the Grand Ole Opry, partly broadcast live by Sirius XM. That show also marked the end of the band's first tour since the 2016 death of Henley's co-founder, singer-guitarist Glenn Frey. ""We're taking it one step at a time,"" Henley says of the reborn lineup with country star Vince Gill and Frey's 23-year-old son Deacon on guitars and vocals. ""But it isn't so much about us as it is the songs. That's what people come to hear.""     It's hard to believe last night was Eagles' Opry debut. ""Lyin' Eyes"" was a Top 10 country hit in 1975.As seasoned as we are in stadiums and arenas, suddenly we're down to an intimate 4,000-seat venue where people are actually listening. There are planks they cut out of the stage at the Ryman Auditorium [the Opry's original home) and inserted into the stage at Opryland. We all took turns standing on it to see if anything would rub off.     Did you listen to the&nbsp;Grand Ole Opry radio show as a kid, growing up in Texas?I don't think we heard it on the radio. We watched it sometimes after it became a television show. What we had was what we called the country cousin of the Opry, which was The Louisiana Hayride out of Shreveport, Louisiana. Guys like Johnny Cash and George Jones â€“ they went down to Shreveport. That's where Elvis Presley made his first live broadcast in 1954.     What was the impact on you musically? You took the turn to rock but listening to that music on The Louisiana Hayride clearly left a mark which can be heard on the first Eagles records.I would listen to the Hayride with my dad when I would go to work with him in the summertime. It was a 30-minute drive each way, and he would turn that program on. In the Sixties, rock &amp; roll became a cultural force, and country music was looked down on as square. Then Gram Parsons made it OK again. He invented the genre of long-haired country music when George Jones still had a flat-top haircut. That said to me, ""It's alright to blend these genres now. It reflects the old and new."" It seemed like something that I'd been looking for the whole time.     During last night's show, Gill dedicated ""New Kid in Town"" to Deacon. In fact, with Gill, there are two new kids in your band.It was a no-brainer for us to get Vince. Nobody else, other than Deacon, was even discussed. Glenn played golf with him. And Vince was in a band called Pure Prairie League. They did a style of music similar to ours â€“ country-influenced pop. He fit like a glove. And his personality is great. He's just glad to be there. He's probably the happiest guy onstage.     It's interesting to hear Gill sing tunes associated with Glenn. Gill has a lighter tone in his voice.He has struck a nice balance between honoring what Glenn did, then putting his own little spin on it. In the beginning, he was trying to sing the songs exactly as Glenn sang them in phrasing and emphasis. But over the past few shows, he's put his own twist and interpretation on the songs. It makes it more authentic to him.     Deacon, in turn, had to grow up fast in his father's shoes.It's extraordinary what that young man has done. I saw him sing ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"" at his father's memorial service. As difficult as that might have been, he was so brave and composed. I'm sure, on the inside, he was churning. After a few months went by, I thought, ""Why not see if he would like to be in the band?""     Did you ever question whether it was right to continue without Glenn?Yes, I did. The only way it felt justified to me was to have family blood in the band. And I have to hand it to Deacon. We rehearsed for a couple of months. And his first gig with us was at Dodger Stadium [at the Classic West festival on July 15th]. He had done some gigs with his father â€“ private parties, clubs, in front of maybe 200 people. To go from that to 55,000 people is extraordinary. I don't know many people who could have done that without freaking out.     Did you have any advice for him before going onstage that day?[Guitarist] Joe Walsh and I told him not to think about it too much [laughs] â€“ just concentrate on the job. It's a double-edged sword for Deacon. He is honored to be carrying on his dad's legacy. On the other hand, it reminds him poignantly of his dad, when he is sitting in dressing rooms where his dad sat, when he's onstage where his dad was. There is the wonderful part of it and the sadness that goes with it.     I've told him that he doesn't need to feel obligated to do this indefinitely, that he doesn't have to stand in his father's shadow. If he wants to start his own band and write his own music, he should do that. He can do this as long as we all agree that we want to do it. He may want to carve out his own future, and that's just fine.     What is it like to play some of those Seventies hits â€“ with that sardonic eye on consumerism and self-absorption â€“ in the age of Trump? Most of this tour ran through the heart of his base: North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan.Which is why we don't speak about politics onstage. We let the music do the talking. People have their own interpretations of these songs. They may connect them to current events. A lot of people connect them to the past. And the past is always bathed in a golden light. It always looks better than it really was. I said something onstage last night: ""This song is from 1974. You thought things were crazy then."" But that's as far as I was gonna go. People can infer from that what they want.    We'd been doing ""The Last Resort"" [from Hotel California] in the set. It goes over like gangbusters in some parts of the country, because it really is a song about manifest destiny. But we pick and choose where to do it. We have too many ballads in the set anyway.     The reissue of Hotel California is the first time you have given an Eagles album the bonus-track treatment. Why did you pick that album instead of starting at the beginning, with your 1972 debut album, Eagles?We picked it because it had the most impact of our studio albums. The song itself has become one of those songs like ""Stairway to Heaven"" [laughs]. The album came out in December 1976. But it didn't really make an impact on the radio until February of  '77. I'm so thrilled we had the foresight to record those things at the Forum. I didn't even realize that we had done that â€“ playing songs from Hotel California before it was out. We were doing things that nobody had heard on the radio yet.    How did they go over?[Laughs] I guess they went over OK. The live tracks were tighter than I remember them being. I thought we were all over the place. But it was pretty well played.     Did you have a sense, during the sessions for Hotel California, that you had turned an important corner as a writing and recording band â€“ and in your commercial appeal?We realized we had taken another step in the evolution of the band, as songwriters and players, in the studio. We were fully aware that we were taking a leap forward. We had [guitarist] Don Felder in the band, and that was part of the edge.    You had that double-lead-guitar action with Felder and Walsh, who had just joined. Their pinpoint-harmony soloing in ""Hotel California"" speaks to your perfectionist streak as a band â€“ that a guitar solo is not just about showing off. It has to have a melodic and narrative arc.Rather than perfectionism, I like to refer to it as craftsmanship. Songwriting and recording are an art, but they are also a craft. Don and Joe sat down and worked on those solos for days. Then [producer] Bill Szymczyk and I did some editing on those solos. Then they relearned the parts after we edited them together.    They'll be pissed at me for saying this [laughs], but that wasn't them just sitting down and spontaneously playing it in one take. That was weeks of work to get there. I'm not taking anything away. I have to give them props. They wrote those solos, worked over those harmony parts for days, then played them over and over again.     Is there anything else in the vaults worthy of future deluxe reissues? The Long Run was supposed to be a double album.We've been through the vaults three or four times at the urging of the record label. There's nothing else there. There were a few things that got started for The Long Run, but they didn't have enough steam. They never got finished. If I had my way, they would never be released. Glenn wouldn't want them out.     What are your plans for 2018 â€“ more touring, the studio?There is nothing etched in stone. Deacon wants to start writing. I think our management is holding some venues, as managers are wont to do. Everyone is so tired from the last two years, what we've been through, that we need a break. After the holidays, as we have traditionally done, we will get together in January and talk about what we want to do â€“ whether we want to do anything, how much we want to do, when to do it. As Glenn used to say, we run this band on a yearly basis. That's still the way it is.     I turned 70 this past July. [Bassist] Timothy Schmit turns 70 today [October 30th]. Joe's 70th is coming up at the end of November. If we can go out and deliver quality performances that our fans have come to expect and that our fans deserve, then we'll probably do some more shows. But when the quality of the performance starts diminishing, I think we'll need to think about hanging it up.    Last night at the Opry, when you opened with the cover of Steve Young's ""Seven Bridges Road,"" you started with that full set of voices in bracing, a cappella harmony â€“ as if to say, ""We're still capable of this.""We picked that as our starter because it does showcase everything and everybody: ""We're still doing OK.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,David Browne,2018-01-17T20:13:00.000Z,Dolores O'Riordan: Cranberries' Noel Hogan Talks Singer's Life and Legacy,"dolores o riordan, dolores o riordan, cranberries interview, dolores cranberries death, dolores o riordan death",Rolling Stone,"Earlier this week, the body of Cranberries singer Dolores Oâ€™Riordan was found in a London hotel room. While police have yet to establish a cause of death for the 46-year-old musician, her bandmates and family have been absorbing it all and requesting privacy.&nbsp;""My friend, partner, and the love of my life is gone,"" O'Riordan's partner OlÃ© Koretsky said in a statement. ""My heart is broken and it is beyond repair.""Noel Hogan, the Cranberries guitarist who co-founded the group and co-wrote many of their songs with O'Riordan, maintained a decades-long friendship with the singer. The band had planned to tour last year, but cancelled the trek due to O'Riordan's ""ongoing back problem."" Speaking to Rolling Stone via e-mail, Hogan spoke about the singer's life, influence and legacy.My earliest memory of Dolores singing is the first day I met her [in 1990]. We used to rehearse in a local studio in Limerick called Xeric. Dolores came in to hear us play and we got to hear her sing. She had a small keyboard that she set up and sang a few songs she had written. We were all blown away that this small girl from Limerick had such an amazing voice. The fact that she wasn't already in a band was a miracle.         In my opinion, what made Dolores connect with people was her honesty. What you saw was what you got. In the early days, the band was very shy; especially Dolores. She sang with her back to the audience but sang songs that people could relate to. There was no big act. I donâ€™t think people were used to this, and it seemed to resonate with them.         Iâ€™m not sure at what point Dolores accepted fame, or if she ever did. We would get a great kick out of it all, as if it were someone else that people were coming to see or talk about. Dolores was a very private person under it all. It was like she went to work and became Dolores the public version, then went home and lived her life away from all that.""I'm not sure at what point Dolores accepted fame, or if she ever did.""Like anyone, Dolores had grown up by the time our later albums [like 2012's&nbsp;Roses] came out. When we were in our twenties, we had something to prove. You keep pushing and worrying about what people think. By the time Dolores did the last two albums, she was very relaxed in herself. The pressure was off and it was a great atmosphere to work in. I think she felt far more confident as an artist by then.         She was so disappointed when we had to cancel the last tour. She had looked forward to it for so long. She did everything in her power to fix the back problem, but it persisted and won in the end. We were about to start the next album in the coming months â€“ along with some shows we were looking at. We had hoped the first of these would have been this March.         I spoke to Dolores last Friday and she was great. We spoke about getting back to work â€“ recording and new tracks we were working on. She sent some of those tracks to me by email on Sunday morning.         Dolores had a lot of things going on in her life over the past 10 years â€“ good and bad. But she was like a sister to me, and like any family member you would worry and try to be there for them when they need you. It was hard at times, but at the end of the day we would always end up staying in touch. It was a friendship for 29 years.Dolores' legacy will be her music. She was so passionate about it. There are songs I hear today that we wrote over 20 years ago, and I see and hear people singing along with them. There are only a few artists who get to have maybe one song they are remembered by. Dolores has so many. Itâ€™s a great legacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,Andy Greene,2017-12-19T17:15:00.000Z,Journey Guitarist Neal Schon Plots Benefit Concert Amid Band Tension,"Neal Schon interview, Neal Schon Journey, Journey 2018 tour, Journey Fire Relief Benefit",Rolling Stone,"It's been a year of extreme ups and downs for&nbsp;Journey. Last April, the group was&nbsp;triumphantly inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, featuring their first onstage appearance with Steve Perry in over a quarter century. Journey also headlined a successful arena tour and performed at Classic East and Classic West alongside Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles.But behind the scenes, the group was melting down. Tension between guitarist Neal Schon and keyboardist Jonathan Cain aired on social media last summer. The trouble appeared to stem from Cain publicizing his Born Again Christian beliefs and members of Journey visiting the White House in July, where they were photographed with President Trump. (Cain's wife, Paula White, delivered the invocation at Trump's presidential inauguration.) Schon, a founding member of Journey, was notably absent. ""I was not informed by anyone about the White House visit,"" Schon tells Rolling Stone in a brief interview. ""They have said many times that I wasn't invited. That being said, I wouldn't have wanted to be. We've up to that point never been involved with anything political or anything evangelical or any one religion. Being the founding member ... I felt I should have been informed as they went as Journey, not individually.""Schon was also upset that Cain is uninterested in recording new Journey music. ""Jonathan apparently is telling people that we are not getting along because of creative differences,"" Schon&nbsp;tweeted on June 7th. ""Not so. We haven't been creative."" Later, he alleged that the band might somehow go on the road without him. ""How would you feel if u found out that the rest of the band wanted to tour without me?"" he wrote. But Schon also seemed to be ready to end the Journey tour. ""Only 2 more shows D.C. And NYC,"" he tweeted on July 27th. ""Then I will fix this all.""&nbsp;But Schon's conflicted reports masked a major medical condition he was quietly facing on the road. ""I was diagnosed with a serious case of double pneumonia in Washington, D.C., in the middle of the tour,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""I continued touring against doctors' advice for everyone's sake including the other bands that were touring with us at the time.""After a small reprieve, Schon will return to the stage on February 9th, for a special show with original Journey singer/keyboardist Gregg Rolie and former Journey drummer Deen Castronovo. The concert will benefit North Bay Fire Relief. Schon says the show will spotlight three songs from Journey's first three albums along with selections from their latter work. He also just released a four-track EP that features instrumental rendition of ""Ava Maria"" and ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" along with the Journey hits ""Faithfully"" and ""Open Arms.""What will the rest of 2018 hold for Journey? Schon wants to get back on the road.&nbsp;There are already strong indications that a co-headlining tour with Def Leppard will be announced. ""I'm ready,"" Schon says.&nbsp;""I'm just waiting to hear the word from management."" The turmoil of this year coupled with his decision to play the North Bay Fire Relief show without any members of the current Journey might suggest that changes to the band are imminent. But Schon says the lineup won't change.&nbsp;Schon was more evasive when asked who controlled the band name and whether he had the legal authority to dump Cain and continue on as Journey. ""I am not worried about it,"" he said. ""I think my fans know who I am.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,Brittany Spanos,2017-11-08T17:17:00.000Z,Shamir's Rough Road to 'Revelations',"shamir, shamir revelations, shamir new music, shamir interview, shamir rolling stone, shamir new album, shamir ratchet, shamir hope, shamir bipolar disorder",Rolling Stone,"Back in 2015, Shamir Bailey had the world at his fingertips. He had signed to XL, the label that helped turn artists like Adele, Vampire Weekend and FKA Twigs into megastars. His debut album,&nbsp;Ratchet, and viral electro-pop single ""On the Regular"" had earned him serious buzz. But between then and the release of his new LP, the much more lo-fi Revelations, he has seen his career â€“ and his mental health â€“ go through the ringer.""I thought that it was just going to be a humble debut,"" Bailey says, looking back on Ratchet while drinking a whiskey at Brooklyn restaurant Roberta's on a sunny October afternoon. He had written much of that album a 15-minute walk away at the Silent Barn, a DIY collective where he had also lived for a bit of time.  ""I didn't think it would [take off]. Towards the end of that I was like, 'What have I done?'""Back in his hometown of Las Vegas, Bailey had played with punk and DIY bands in the city's tiny scene. He eventually made it to South by Southwest and gained a small following, issuing his first EP and single through indie label Godmode.""I had no big label aspirations,"" he admits. ""It was just a whirlwind, and I just went along with it the best I could, really.""The cracks began to show early. ""I used to get in trouble because I would sneak away to Philly,"" he recalls. Bailey ended up moving there after wrapping up Ratchet promotional tours at the end of 2015. But it wasn't until last year that he really ""shot the first shot,"" as he describes, the one that would set in motion the termination of his record contract.""I was depressed because I was actually scared to write music. I was like, 'I'm not going to be able to write music by myself anymore,'"" he explains. He began binge-eating and gained 60 pounds. The day before he had to launch festival-season gigs, he showed up to a meeting with his A&amp;R sporting a shaved head.""They didn't say [they were mad] to my face, but I was dropped a few months later,""&nbsp;he says of his drastic appearance change. As Bailey perceives it, XL's focus had been on artists with more ""niche"" careers, sounds and styles; specifically he singles out signees Adele and FKA Twigs. Shaving his head was a rebellion against feeling trapped in certain sound and image.After he was dropped from XL, his now-former management team set up sessions with big-name producers in Los Angeles who had worked with artists like Kanye West and Justin Bieber. The resulting unreleased material was too ""clean,"" Bailey says. So he went back to Philly and recorded a full album's worth of fresh songs with a close friend before the friend, whose name he says he'd like to keep anonymous, had a ""freak out,"" as he describes.""That was so hard. I was just like, 'Wow, I scrapped two albums,'"" he says.Then came Hope. It's a messy, gritty, fuzzy lo-fi rock album Bailey debuted on SoundCloud in April, the weekend after his friend refused to release the album they had worked on together. ""In the back of my mind, I was going to quit music. But I was going to have the last laugh.""The outpouring was unexpected. Fans reacted positively to the quickly written and recorded songs, responding to visceral sound of Bailey's playing and singing. He started reevaluating his decision to leave music behind. A week after Hope's release, Bailey's best friend from Las Vegas came to visit him in Philly to record some music. But at the time, when Bailey was feeling as positive about creating music and his career as he had in years, he was suffering a severe manic episode that he wasn't totally aware of.""Hope was the starting point of this time being manic,"" he explains. ""I have had the downs before but never a manic episode. I started being super delusional. There were voices in my head telling me to do certain things, and I believed it. I felt bad for my friend because she didn't know how to react.""Bailey began to believe he had gained psychic abilities in the weeks following. He made the mistake of self-medicating with marijuana to ease the anxiety and insomnia but it sent him deeper into his delusions. ""I fell into psychosis,"" he says. ""My friend who had just visited messaged me something on Facebook, and [my response] scared her so she called me and my mom. I stayed on the phone with them until the police came.""His mom flew out from Vegas to be with him as he was checked into a local hospital for a week where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She brought her son back to Vegas with her, where he stayed for most of this past summer before returning to Philly in July. It was in his hometown where Revelations, Bailey's third full-length album, was born. He transformed a corner of his aunt's house into a mini-studio with his 4-track and guitar.&nbsp;""That's what kept me company,"" he says. What he created is an extension of Hope, though crafted with a bit more time and care. It was also a return to the guitar-driven sound of his early career. ""Everyone I was close to and showed the songs to was just like, 'It sounds like you,'"" he reveals. Revelations tracks like ""You Have a Song"" and ""Her Story"" feature heavy bass lines, crunchy guitars and general Nineties-leaning rock nostalgia. ""They know that Ratchet was more of an experience of me that just took on a life of its own. My old band was more funk, guitar-driven stuff."" This time around, Bailey again has label support. San Francisco indie imprint Father/Daughter had reached out immediately following the self-release of Hope, though he was deep in his psychosis at the time. He dropped his old management, too, after their less-than-positive reaction to his sudden April album. Now, he manages himself.""I think this is the most content I have felt in my career, period,"" he says with visible relief. ""I didn't think I would get to this point so quickly, and if it weren't for the negative and bad things I went through, it wouldn't have happened.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It's kind of a whole beginning and end,"" he tells us by telephone, ""although I don't think the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the end, but it's a long journey that vaguely started in Cleveland and vaguely comes to some resolve in Cleveland again.""Ocasek spoke to us about the honor, what songs he thinks the Cars will play that night, the possibility of a future Cars album and tour, and why things have never felt the same since bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000.Congratulations.Thank you! It's pretty nice. I'm pretty grateful we were accepted.How did you first hear about it?I kind of heard about it this morning when I woke up.You didn't hear before?Last night, late at night, they kind of told me, but I wasn't really sure since you never know.What was your first reaction?It made me feel pretty upbeat. It's funny. The first time I ever heard Ben [Orr], he was 16 years old and he played on a TV show in Cleveland called Upbeat. He was singing ""You Came Into My Life"" with his band the Grasshoppers. That was in Cleveland, Ohio, since I used to live there, where the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is. I graduated from [Maple Heights] High School in 1963. In fact, the first time I ever played live by myself on acoustic guitar was when I snuck into a folk club to try out. That was quite an experience. Also in Cleveland, first time I ever smoked a joint.What does this honor mean to you on a personal level?Gee, any time you get an award for something, whether its a bowling trophy or whatever, you feel a little special from it, I suppose. It's certainly a wonderful feeling to be accepted by peers and you see the people that are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who gets inducted, it's a positive feeling that you get. I think it's kind of a big thing for me and the band. I know Ben would have been flipped out by it. I think everyone will be, but I haven't even spoke to the band today. It's certainly a very positive thing.Are you surprised?Yeah. I don't know. ... I don't know if every band thinks they'd like to be in it. A lot of years go by and you go, ""Gee, I wonder if I'll ever get in there. Have we done enough music or enough things that were original or different to get you into that situation?"" I kind of used to think we were a pretty good candidate. It wasn't until a few years ago when we first got nominated that I thought, ""Wow, we kind of are a candidate."" The first year I was very apprehensive about it, whether we'd get in or not, and we didn't. The second year I pretty much ignored it. This year I was ignoring it as well, so it was kind of a surprise we got in this year. There were a lot of bands on the list to get in that didn't get in.Do you think the band is going to perform at the ceremony?We probably will. I don't know in which way we will. I've been thinking about that a bit since it came up. There's all kinds of different scenarios we could do. I don't know how, but I assume it would be expected and I'd be prepared for that.Artists usually play three songs. Can you think of three that would sum up the whole career?Yeah. ""Heroin"" by the Velvet Underground. [Laughs] Let's see, a good Bob Dylan song. ... It's kind of funny. I think people would want to hear something they know very well. I could go out there and try and be esoteric and play obscure songs from the records, but I think they'll want to hear something they know. That's the thing. How should we present it in a different way? Maybe not. Off the top of my head I can imagine ""Just What I Needed"" and ""Drive"" or something. That's what people would expect. There's no reason to play something they wouldn't expect.It's you guys, Dire Straits, Bon Jovi, the Moody Blues and Nina Simone. Are you a fan of those acts?I'm a fan of the Moody Blues. I also like Dire Straits. All the bands that got in are definitely worthy of getting in. If you were asking me what music I'd listen to out of those, the ones I'd listen to most would be the Moody Blues since I remember them from the 1960s.Are you able to imagine an all-star jam with everyone?I've never done that before, but I guess I could as long as I could be in the back. I'd be behind the drums, hiding. We've never really been a jam band, but I can see that happening. Maybe.You think Ben would definitely be thrilled by this, right?Without a doubt. He grew up in Parma Heights, Ohio. As I said, he was on TV a lot. There was a weekly TV show he was on called Upbeat and the Grasshoppers were the big stars of it. He was a good-looking 16-year-old singing wonderful songs with that great voice. He's been inundated with music since he was a kid. He was pretty proud to have come from Cleveland. I lived in Cleveland for maybe six or seven years, through high school. Before that I lived in Baltimore, but after Cleveland I traveled everywhere.Cleveland is pretty dear to me since it was a launching pad for a lot of things. The first time I ever saw the Velvet Underground was in Cleveland. I went to a party at somebody's apartment with the Velvet Underground. La Cave was a great new-music kind of place in the 1960s. Ohio was good for that. Back then, it was wonderful. Of course, the 1960s were a very vibrant time anyways. Everything was going on between 1963 and 1969 or something. It was pretty exciting.I saw you guys in 2011 at Roseland Balloom. Why was that tour so brief?Well, I guess you could blame it on me. I toured a lot when we were the Cars, the five of us. I saw the world. I've always been more of a songwriter than a performer. I produce and I love the studio. I've always not so much liked touring. That's kind of the reason. Also, I didn't want to do things like, ""Hey, let's do some casinos and some boats."" I didn't want to get into that. That's just a different reason to do it. That's really just being mechanical and playing your songs for whatever it is. I have to say that everyone else in the band would have loved to be constantly on the road. There's a lot of bands that do that. I guess it's just me personally. I didn't like that aspect of it as much. I mean, I produced 50 fucking albums, more than 50 actually. There's a lot of time spent doing things like that that nobody knows about.Did you have fun playing Lollapalooza and the few shows you did play?I did like Lollapalooza a lot. I liked the tour actually. After the tour I was like, ""Maybe keep going? I don't know. We kind of already made the decision.""Are you thinking about a future Cars tour or a future Cars album? Is that even in your head at this point?It's funny. Before all this, I was planning on writing a record this year. I don't know whether I would have put it out myself or asked the Cars to come along. We all live far from each other. I don't know. Maybe so. Maybe this will be a good reason to do it again, though I really miss Ben as part of the thing. As much as I want it to be the Cars and I love everyone so much in the Cars, without him it just feels different. It feels different.Do you think about Ben a lot?He was certainly my closest friend. He was in every band I ever had. It was a pretty close relationship. He crosses my mind a lot. I certainly see pictures of him around or I hear his voice. It's funny, for some of these re-release things we would find some alternative cuts or things. I'd find demos or recordings where Ben and I played acoustically at Cambridge, Massachusetts, those clubs around Harvard. It was just him and I. They were kind of great. Every time I heard him sing on anything, whether it was a demo or a living room, it always sounded amazing. I could never get over how great his voice was, at least to me. So yeah, I think about him. Unfortunately, there were a lot of artists I was close to we lost in the past couple of years, Alan Vega and a bunch ... I guess time rolls on.Do you have songs written for your next album?I could easily do a solo album. I have songs. I've actually been doing some art shows recently, so I haven't been doing too much writing, but I certainly have time to. It's kind of the thing you do anyway, whether you're going to put them out or not. I couldn't just stop doing that.As you said, the Hall of Fame could be the final stand for the Cars, which would be a very appropriate way to wrap it up.In that way, it would be. It would be a good cap on the bottle. If you had to pick one, I don't think you could think of one after that as big as that particular situation. I've got that in my mind. I've thought about that just the way you put it. I thought, ""I kind of started playing here and I could stop playing here, in Cleveland. This could be the bookends. One guy on a guitar playing bad songs and then I'm in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 45 years later.""It's kind of weird because it's like a lifetime. It is a lifetime. I had three families during that time. They are like lives that go by and millions of people and things and artists and writers and business people and fans. ... It's a lot of stuff. It's been a pretty eventful life, I can say.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,Andy Greene,2017-11-29T14:49:26.506Z,Fall Out Boy's Midlife Crisis,"fall out boy, fall out boy tour, fall out boy songs, fall out boy mania, fall out boy mania setlist, fall out boy albums, fall out boy members, fall out boy lyrics, pete wentz, fall out boy singer",Rolling Stone,"Patrick Stump was listening to Fall Out Boy's almost-complete seventh album, Mania, in July when he realized there was a major problem: It wasn't very good. ""It freaked me out,"" the singer says. ""I was like, 'I don't think this is something the four of us will like, I don't think it's something the label is going to like. It doesn't sound like Fall Out Boy. Oh, God, I can't turn this in.'"" Stump told bassist Pete Wentz, who felt the same way; they decided to push the album back to January, even though they'd already committed to an American arena tour in the fall to support it.The episode was the first major snafu Fall Out Boy had seen since 2013. Back then, after a four-year breakup, they returned to score huge pop-radio hits like ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark"" and ""Centuries."" But the group's Mania singles from earlier this year, the EDM-flavored ""Young and Menace"" and ""Champion,"" which had an old-school FOB vibe, failed to even crack the Hot 100. ""The songs were trying to serve everybody, but they weren't going to be compelling to anybody,"" Wentz says of the scrapped album's tunes. ""It felt like all bread and no meat. There was no spicy mustard or anything.""If the pressure of redoing much of the album while preparing for an arena tour has caused the band any stress or turmoil, it certainly isn't apparent backstage at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia. Killing time after soundcheck, the band holds a series of supremely dorky conversations; Wentz defends the much-maligned Terminator: Salvation, starring Christian Bale, and hypothesizes that Adam Driver's character might ultimately turn out to be a good guy in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Stranger Things 2 is also a big topic. ""There are moments on Stranger Things where Sean Astin really looks like [his Lord of the Rings character] Samwise Gamgee,"" says guitarist Joe Trohman. ""Hey!"" says drummer Andy Hurley. ""No spoilers!""In August, the band returned to the studio with producer Illangelo â€“ best known for his work with Lady Gaga, Drake and the Weeknd â€“ and decided to start largely from scratch. An intensive songwriting boot camp at Stump's Burbank, California, studio worked, yielding songs like the trap-infused ""Hold Me Tight or Don't"" and the synth-y ""Expensive Mistakes."" It helped that the deadline to deliver the album had been extended. ""It was Thanksgiving, when the old guy unbuttons his belt and just exhales,"" Stump says. ""We were relaxed, and the rest of the record kind of wrote itself in a week.""Those songs are a hit at the sold-out show that night in Fairfax, where the crowd sings along to every word of old hits like ""Dance, Dance,"" ""This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race"" and ""Sugar, We're Goin Down."" The tour coincides with a renewed interest in the emo scene of the Nineties and early 2000s, with bands like Brand New and Say Anything playing to big crowds again. Though those groups were their early peers, Fall Out Boy see themselves as a separate entity. ""None of the emo bands messed with us,"" says Stump. ""They hated us. They wouldn't tour with us."" Adds Trohman, ""I'm going to sound like a jerk, but we are still doing the band and making records â€“ we are not on a 10-year-anniversary tour. We are still an active band. That is not an easy thing to do."" For that reason, the band let the 10-year anniversary of 2007's Infinity on High pass by this year without any sort of special tour or box set. ""A band like us could get stuck if we did that,"" says Wentz. ""It's a loop, and we'd be doing it forever.""Another example of Fall Out Boy's privileged position: Before a proper American tour for Mania in 2018, the band will hit the Jingle Ball circuit in December, playing on the same bills as Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, the Chainsmokers, Niall Horan and Camila Cabello. In every case, Fall Out Boy are the oldest act on the bill â€“ and the only rock band. ""When we play those things it literally feels like we're Slayer or something,"" says Wentz. ""Then we play the modern rock shows and we're the pop band. It's a little bizarre.""Stump acknowledges that even after all the work they put in, he won't mind if the reworked Mania doesn't connect with radio: ""Do I need another hit in my life? I don't really care. The only reason to put out a record is if it's really great. And once you are past the radio-hit stage of your career, that becomes even more important.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,David Browne,2018-02-06T16:54:00.000Z,Inside Music's Merch Gold Rush,"music merch, manhead, manhead merch",Rolling Stone,"Three years ago, Fall Out Boy opened a pop-up store in New York, selling T-shirts in a space that resembled a punk-rock club. When the band revisited the idea at stores in New York and L.A. this past fall, the vibe and decor were noticeably upgraded. Purple-tinted windows made fans feel as if they were walking into the cover of the band's new album, Mania, and among the items on sale were hand-painted $150 denim jackets. ""It's bigger now, and more money is coming through,"" says Chris Cornell, whose merch company, Manhead, works with Fall Out Boy, Shania Twain and other artists. ""It's amazing how far it's come."" Music merchandise (T-shirts, posters, etc.), once an ancillary part of an artist's income, has become a booming business. In 2016, sales of music merch hit $3.1 billion, a 10 percent increase from the year before, says the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association. Retail-analytics group Edited claims that the sheer volume of music-related items on the market has tripled in the past two years. ""Music has migrated to being more digital,"" says Mat Vlasic, who runs the merch company Bravado, ""so fans are craving something physical.""At artist-affiliated online stores, retail outlets, pop-up shops and concerts, fans are now confronted by an increasingly high-end variety of consumer choices: $240 denim sherpa jackets (the Weeknd), $1,050 thigh-high boots (Kanye West) and $1,095 Canada Goose bomber jackets with collars made of coyote fur (Drake's OVO line). As this new profit center has taken off, artists themselves are getting more involved in day-to-day operations. Taylor Swift and Morrissey opened pop-up stores in the fall, and Iggy Pop made color suggestions for his new line of Billabong board shorts. Recently, BeyoncÃ© and Jared Leto both invested in Sidestep, an app that allows fans to buy concert merch online and pick it up at the venue prior to a show. ""Some people like standing in line,"" says Jesper Poulsen of the licensing firm Epic Rights. ""For me, personally, it's a buzzkill.""Although some in the industry question West's claim that he sold $1 million in merchandise in two days during a pop-up-store event in 2016, there's no question that profits can be sizable. Drake's pop-up events have brought in six-figure sales numbers. According to Panic! At the Disco's manager, Bob McLynn, 30 percent of the band's profit on its most recent tour came from merch. ""Ever since CDs started going by the wayside, everyone was like, 'How are we going to make more money?'â€‰"" says Cornell.In a sign of the merch world's flourishing success, asecondary market has emerged at its margins: Fans are scooping up items atpop-up stores and reselling them online at pumped-up prices. ""They'regetting a couple of hundred dollars for a T-shirt that cost $25,"" saysFrances Wong of Sony's Thread Shop merch agency. ""After our Tribe CalledQuest pop-up, people were selling the shopping bags online for $25. It washilarious.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,Kory Grow,2018-02-13T16:53:02.567Z,Superchunk on Finding Hope in Trump Resistance,Superchunk,Rolling Stone,"Superchunk frontman Mac McCaughan can vividly recall what he felt the moment he learned that Donald Trump had been elected president: ""horror, depression, sadness."" Rather than bottle up those feelings, which escalated in the weeks to come as he saw the alt-right gain newfound confidence, he began work on what would become the indie-rock group's 11th studio album, What a Time to Be Alive, written entirely between November 2016 and February 2017. The title is sardonic.""It seemed it would be weird to write about anything else,"" he says in his inimitably high voice on a phone call from his home in North Carolina. ""It's been dominating my psyche and it's hard to get away from everything. Some of the record is about how do you get away from it all? How do you live in that environment where it's everywhere and still lead a life? I don't know if there is an answer to that.""The band recorded the LP in two sessions, one in February and another in July. He can't remember which song he wrote first, but the swinging rocker ""I Got Cut"" â€“ which contains the line ""All these old men won't die too soon"" â€“ and ""Break the Glass,"" a throbbing number about parsing the way the world was changing, both came early in the process. Rather than howl into the void, McCaughan and his bandmates released the songs ahead of the album as benefit singles, with proceeds from ""Break the Glass"" going to the Southern Poverty Law Center and ""I Got Cut"" going to Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. The recording sessions went quickly, and McCaughan &amp; Co. were so revved up they wrote the 74-second punk number ""Cloud of Hate"" in about 15 minutes to round out their time in the studio; it contains these pointed lyrics aimed at the president and the alt-right: ""You scare the kids/I hope you die scared of all the kids that know the truth.""""My kids are old enough to wake up in the morning and be like, 'Who won?' and then start crying when they got the answer,"" McCaughan says. ""So the record is not even just about what's in our heads; it's seeing the effect on other people around you. It's rough.""But that said, he hopes that people find a few optimistic moments in the album. ""I don't want this to be portrayed as a 'political album' or an 'angry album,'"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""I hope it's still fun to listen to. For us, the songs are still the most important thing and all that is still there.""The title song is incredibly sarcastic, but the tune itself is upbeat. How did you manage that? I don't think the sarcasm is necessarily super productive in the end, at least on its own. So with that, I was conscious of having a balance between what might just erupt out of you, which is sarcasm or anger, and balance it with sincerity and actual thoughtfulness. I don't know if ""hope"" is too strong of a word [laughs]. It's kind of a loaded word after the eight years before this, but I was just trying to strike a balance there.What was going on at the time the song came to you? That was a reaction to all these articles newspapers were publishing about the alt-right, people who were basically Nazis, but describing them as ""disruptors"" or ""a new, clean-cut version of what we used to call Nazis."" Like, ""Look at how stylish they are."" It was this willingness to feed both sides of issues where there are not both sides. There's one side, and it's that these people are horrible, racist and Nazis, and they shouldn't be given the respect you're giving them.  Is it weird for you to be living in North Carolina, where enough people voted for Trump for the state to go red, feeling the way you do? Well, North Carolina went for Obama in '08 and then Romney in 2012 and then Trump obviously. It's been terrible in North Carolina for a while because Republicans have gerrymandered the state beyond recognition and taken over the state government for a while. It is frustrating in some ways. They don't even try to hide keeping black people from voting.The one good piece of news was that a Democratic governor was elected at the same time as Trump. But I've lived here since I was 13 years old. The part of the state where we live is more progressive and headed in the right direction versus the rest of the South. There are great people here and I still think there's still a chance for North Carolina and everywhere to move in the right direction.You have a line in ""Bad Choices"" about meeting your neighbors to better understand them. That line was about the narrative of progressives or ""coastal elites"" living in a bubble. I feel like the story of people living in a bubble is really the reverse of how it's been reported. The people who voted for Trump and people who feel like they're somehow reclaiming their place in society after being left behind by Obama, these are the people that have created a bubble for themselves and these are the people that need to get out of it and see what the real world is like. A good example is how Trump would go to these towns and campaign about inner-city crime in white townships â€“ not in the inner cities. The cities that have the most immigrants and most diverse populations aren't scared of immigrants and diverse populations.Knowing that Hillary won more votes and that everybody else in the country has to suffer for these bad choices that people living in small, white, cloistered rural areas made when they voted for this racist is incredibly frustrating. Everyone pays for their mistakes.The chorus to ""All For You"" is you throwing down the gauntlet to close-minded people: ""I don't like to get hit but fight me."" What's the worst fight you've ever been in? I don't think I've ever been in a fight in my life unless it was with my sister or my cousin or something [laughs]. I had a few different choruses for that song and I settled on that one partially because it's goofy because of that fact. But in the days following the election, and still occasionally, I leave the house feeling like, ""If I see someone wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat, I will get in a fight."" [Laughs] Feeling that kind of anger is a terrible way to go through life. It's horrible and not healthy and stressful. So a lot of the record is, ""How do I navigate that feeling? How do you talk yourself down from that anger?"" [Laughs]Speaking of anger, the first verse of ""I Got Cut"" goes, ""All these old men won't die too soon,"" and that line is written in all capital letters in the lyrics. Yeah, there's a photograph of Trump and a bunch of old white guys standing around his desk, smiling about the fact that they had just taken reproductive rights away from people around the world. It's just these old guys smiling because they made it harder for women and families to take care of themselves. It's one of the most disgusting pictures that I can imagine. I don't enjoy the feeling of thinking, ""I want all these people to die,"" but I can't wait until they actually do [laughs]. Like Jeff Sessions? I can't wait till he's off the planet after the damage he's doing. I don't go around 24 hours a day feeling like that, but I think sometimes it's good to write it down.There's a song on the album called ""Reagan Youth,"" which is obviously a nod to&nbsp;the punk band's name, but do you feel like the Trump administration has been worse than Reagan?I think it is worse, just because I think what's worse about it is the willingness of everyone on one side of the aisle to go along with every batshit thing that the president does in order to pass the legislation they want passed, whether it's with regard to Roe vs. Wade or giving their millionaire friends a tax break. There are so many things where they're just like, ""Fine. We'll go along with this maniac to get what we want done."" Reagan did a lot of damage, but I don't think he had quite the willing conspirers. The idea that my kids are growing up under this administration is insane, but I do think it's worse.The record features a lot of guests. How did you get everyone to contribute? I don't love the way my voice sounds when I'm singing [laughs] so the opportunity to have someone else's voice in the mix is going to improve our song. I sang a brief backing vocal part on the last Hiss Golden Messenger record, and Skylar Gudasz was in the same session, so I thought of her for ""Black Thread."" And part of the inspiration for ""Break the Glass"" was A Giant Dog, so to have [A Giant Dog's] Sabrina Ellis on there gave the song what it needed; she has a real urgency to her singing. For ""Erasure,"" I wanted someone singing below me and someone above, and Stephen Merritt has the best baritone I know of and Katie [Crutchfield] from Waxahatchee was coming through on tour so she snag her part in person. It was incredible. As someone who's not a ""nail it on the first take"" vocalist, working with someone like Katie and Skylar made it seem effortless [laughs].Was the point to have a lot of different voices represented?I really liked the idea of this record having a community feel to it, because when times are dire and you feel like the country's been taken over by insane authoritarian racists, you just go, ""What good is what I'm doing? What can being in a band or playing a song matter?"" It feels slightly inconsequential. What does feel consequential, for instance, is the Women's March on Washington. Our whole family did that and being in a group of people and working as a group of people feels consequential. So to have our band and many other artists as we can get involved â€“ having that feeling of a community â€“ is something where you can take a step back from thinking ""What good is it being in a band?"" There's a real strength in community and that can give you optimism.You stopped writing the album last February. When and how did you know that it was done? There was some urgency to it in that two years from now, this record might not feel the same. We wrote the songs fast and there was a window in everyone's schedule to record them quickly, so we figured, ""Let's not labor over it. Let's just release it."" We've never spent a ton of time in the studio, but there are records of ours with more flourishes or more atmosphere, and this record felt like one that didn't need that. This is the first record we've done without keyboards probably since [1993's] On the Mouth. It's a punk record, really. So when I felt there were enough songs for it to be an album, we recorded them. Like, why drag it out? We could have kept writing but no one wants to hear a double album of songs like this, right?Did writing this album help you find a new perspective on how you feel? I don't know if I have a different perspective, but it gave me somewhere to put my energy. I think that's important for everyone who cares and who's bummed out a lot of days or feeling like shit is going down the drain. Whatever people can find to put their energy, to feel like not crawling back under the covers every day, is a good thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,Kory Grow,2017-12-20T20:41:00.000Z,Cheech and Chong's 'Earache My Eye': From Novelty Hit to Eminem Sample,"tommy chong,tommy chong interview,eminem,eminem untouchable,eminem untouchable sample,eminem cheech and chong,tommy chong eminem,earache my eye,cheech chong earache my eye,eminem earache my eye",Rolling Stone,"Tommy Chong, one half of the comedy duo Cheech and Chong, was certainly pleased to hear the latest Eminem single. ""Untouchable,"" a Revival track on which Em addresses the way African-Americans are mistreated culturally in America, relies heavily on a sample of his group's 1974 rock-star sendup ""Earache My Eye.""""I loved it,"" says Chong, age 79, his voice sounding as warm and genial as it did on the group's Seventies albums. ""It just shows that Eminem has a lot of talent. It's quite an honor.""Chong says that while he didn't speak with Eminem directly about the sample usage, he'd gotten word that the rapper was a big fan. ""All those guys, they're big Cheech and Chong fans,"" he says of rap artists. ""We have quite a large group of talented rappers, movie makers and musicians â€“ everybody â€“ who like what we do."" That's true of ""Earache My Eye,"" a raucous, hilarious heavy-metal track â€“ equal parts Black Sabbath and King Crimson â€“ that first appeared on the 1974 LP Cheech and Chong's Wedding Album and was later featured in the duo's first movie, 1978's Up in Smoke. The tune features the fictional Alice Bowie (played by Cheech Marin) bragging about how ""bloody rich"" he is and how he only knows ""three chords."" It became a Top 10 hit for the group, spending 13 weeks on the chart. Since then, it's been covered or sampled by Soundgarden, Rollins Band, 2 Live Crew and Widespread Panic, among others. Korn even drafted Marin to appear on a cover version they recorded as a hidden track on their 1998 album Follow the Leader.""It was very ironic at the time,"" Chong says of his intention behind it. ""It was just of the times. We wrote it back when rock stars were making lots of money and only knew three chords.""Chong remembers the song coming together when a friend of theirs named Gaye Delorme, whom he says helped start Cheech and Chong, came up with the song's riff. He'd been staying at Marin's home and came out of the bedroom one day, started playing and sang, ""Mama talking to me da-da-da-da-da."" ""The only lyrics he had was 'Mama talking to me,' so I took it and wrote the rest of the lyrics for the song,"" Chong remembers. ""Then we went in the studio with some great musicians. We had Airto Moreira, who was a percussionist with Miles Davis for a long time, on drums and then Gaye was on guitar. The chord changes were very intelligent with a little mixture of jazz and rock, so it wasn't just full-on heavy thrash metal. That's why it was so popular."" Chong gave the song to Marin to sing, because ""he's always been the vocalist"" between the two. ""I engineered and produced it and added that great solo in there,"" Chong says. ""It was just a work of love.""They based the Alice Bowie character off of two of the era's most notorious superstars. ""We'd been on tour with Alice [Cooper] a few times, and we really admired David Bowie,"" Chong says. ""He was such an androgynous kind of character, and then when Cheech would put on the tutu he became Alice Bowie. By the way, I wore the tutu first. Cheech actually got jealous. He wanted to wear the tutu, so I let him.""Years later, they ended up revisiting the song in Up in Smoke when they felt a proposed closing scene for the movie didn't work. ""Cheech and I sort of took over the ending of the movie, so we made it where we wrote the song in minutes and magically had costumes on and a full band for a performance at the Roxy,"" Chong recalls. ""It was just perfect. That way we made it so that we could go on the road. It was another way of keeping Cheech and Chong going into the next adventure.""Now that both Cheech and Chong are in their 70s, Chong is happy with the way their music is finding new audiences.&nbsp;""I love rap, man,"" he says. ""I'm into it. We have the soul of a rapper. We don't have the energy, but we definitely have the soul.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,Andy Greene,2018-01-02T21:46:00.000Z,"Hear Bob Seger Talk About His Health Scare, New Album and Springsteen","Bob Seger, Bob Seger glen frey, Bob Seger interview, Bob Seger tour, rolling stone music now, bob seger albums, bob seger tour injury, bob seger dead, bob seger age, bob seger songs",Rolling Stone,"Bob Seger was having a pretty amazing year up until the morning of September 30th when he woke up and noticed that his left leg was dragging a little bit. His music was finally on streaming services after his management and Capitol Records agreed to terms following a protracted war and he was on tour in support of his new LP I Knew You When, which features tributes to departed rock stars Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen and his lifelong friend Glenn Frey. But before the tour, he suffered a ruptured disc and he was told if the symptoms spread to his legs it would be impossible to continue the tour. ""My doctor said to me, 'Oh no, that's it, you're done with this tour. You're having surgery now,"" says the 72-year-old by phone from his rural Michigan estate. He hopes to reschedule the tour for this spring. ""I'm feeling better all the time,"" he says. ""They aren't letting me lift anything over five pounds. I can't do anything: no piano, no guitar, no nothing. But as soon as the pain stops, I'll be playing again.""To hear the entire interview with Seger, click below or download and subscribe&nbsp;on iTunes or Spotify.&nbsp;You're 72, still touring and releasing new music. Did you ever see that coming?God, no. I thought I'd be done by 30. My original plan was to do it for five years between the age of 25 and 30 and then buy a motorcycle and drive across Europe, and then get a real job. It didn't work out that way. The more you do it, I guess, the more you love it.The new album has two songs about Glenn Frey: ""I Knew You When"" and ""Glenn Song.""He was my oldest friend in music. I met him in 1966, and we recorded ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"" that year. We were just a couple of knuckleheads starting out â€“ he was from Royal Oak [Michigan], and I was from Detroit. He was such a positive influence in my life. We'd always call each other for advice. I pushed him to do that Eagles reunion [in 1994]. He was the only one that didn't want to do it for years. I said to him, ""I think you'd have fun.""What made you want to cover Lou Reed's ""Busload of Faith"" on the new album?Well, he passed away first. The first one I did was a Leonard Cohen song [""Democracy.""] I told [Glenn's wife] Cindy, ""Since I'm doing this, I'm going to salute a couple of my heroes, Lou Reed and Leonard Cohen."" First time I heard the movie was in a movie with James Woods and Robert Downey Jr. called True Believer. I immediately went out and bought the album. I've loved Lou's stuff for years. I think [his 1992 album] Magic and Loss is my favorite. But at any rate, I just love the imagery of ""Busload of Faith."" I see it as a bunch of working people, maybe they can't afford a car and it's cheaper to take a bus. They're going to work and singing, ""These days, you need a busload of faith to get by."" Maybe because of the economic division in our country and stagnant wages and so on and so forth, it felt right to do it now. I contacted Lou's estate and I told them I made a few changes. I dropped one verse about rape and abortion and stuff since I wanted to get it on the radio, if possible. I think that's why a lot of people didn't hear it. There was also a lot of negative religiosity. I really only changed five lines in the whole song.&nbsp;You sing a lot about your high school days on the album, much like you did on classics, like ""Against the Wind"" and ""Night Moves.""It was probably my favorite time. Up until high school, I was super shy. And then I developed a bunch of friends across town and came out of my shell. After that, it was 12 years of doing 250 to 300 shows a year in various bars, universities and gymnasiums.Trump won your home state of Michigan, which had been blue since 1992.Well, I understand it because I live here. The second you got out of town, every rural area had a Trump sign. I never saw a Clinton sign.How do you explain that?It was the rural people who elected him. They're very dissatisfied with Washington and they thought he could do something different and so they did. I'll tell ya, I was at the Kennedy Center Honors honoring Glenn [in December of 2016]. We got in the line to meet Obama and I said, ""Mr. President I just want to say one thing. I thank you for your wisdom and your dignity."" Henley called me the next week and said, ""Well, how'd you like it?"" And I said, ""Man what a great week. I got to be with my best friends in music, you guys and I got to meet my favorite president of my lifetime.""Your music finally made it to streaming services last year. There were many years when it was very hard to access your music.Yes, but at the same time, I canâ€™t complain about my success. My manager hasnâ€™t been wrong too many times. And it could be a reason why we were the biggest-selling catalog album between 2000 and 2010 [Greatest Hits]. Nobody outsold us, and it could be because we stayed off that grid.Are you going to ever write your memoir?I think about it. I set up a computer. I got a writing desk. I got everything ready. I don't know what I'll write, I may write about me. I don't know.You wouldn't get a ghost writer?Oh no. I would do it myself.How about a documentary about your life?The problem with that is that we don't have any film. The Eagles were smart and they made lots of film. We have some, but the lights weren't very good and it looks cruddy.You usually tour with Don Brewer of Grand Funk Railroad on drums. Why wasn't he on this tour?Don was busy. It came up real fast and would've had to delay it a lot. I said, ""Don, I'm sorry, man. I really want to do this. I wanna get out and start playing these songs."" And so he understood. As a&nbsp; matter of fact, we used Grand Funk on a couple of songs. He's still a great friend of mine and I think he's a wonderful drummer. But I just wanted to get out there.&nbsp;I know your favorite TV show used to be The Good Wife. What is it now that that's done?Madame Secretary. I think it's got great writing, great characters. It's very modern. I'm into world affairs. I read a lot. I read the New York Times every day from top to bottom. I watch a lot of political shows to try and keep up with that's happening.I read that Bruce Springsteen's ""Jungleland"" inspired you to write ""Night Moves,"" because it had two bridges.Absolutely. I had the first two verses forever. It took me six months to write it. I just kept coming back to it and was like, ""Nah, that's not it."" Then I heard ""Jungleland."" I remember calling [Don] Henley and saying, ""Have you heard 'Jungleland'?"" He said he didnâ€™t know if he was into Bruce. I read him the line: ""They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign that brings this fair city light."" It's still one of my favorite records.It's been a brutal couple of years in terms of losing rock stars.You sure think about your own mortality. It's important to do what you want to do and follow your own personal vision. It just reinforced that. I worked harder this tour than I ever have. I did songs I'd never done because they were too high. This tour, I didn't care. I wore myself out. People were singing along to every word of ""You'll Accomp'ny Me."" I guess that's the power of Greatest Hits selling 10 million.Many of your earliest albums have been out of print for decades. What's it going to take to get them out?Jack White is always asking me about that. He wants to remix them all, and said he'd do it for free. But I'm always on to the next thing â€“ the next album, the next tour. Maybe when I retire I'll get serious about it.Don't you feel bad for fans who have been waiting for them?No! [Huge belly laugh]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,Suzy Exposito,2017-12-20T18:55:00.000Z,"Ministry's Al Jourgensen on New Trump-Era LP, How Pot Changed His Life","ministry, al jourgensen, al jourgensen interview, al jourgensen rolling stone, ministry rolling stone, al jourgensen cuba, ministry interview, ministry psalm 69",Rolling Stone,"Six years ago, the fate of Ministry was looking grim. Following the untimely 2012 death of longtime guitarist Mike Scaccia, frontman Al Jourgensen declared that he was putting the band to rest. But on the phone with Rolling Stone, Jourgensen seems upbeat, invigorated by his most recent tour with experimental hip-hop outfit Death Grips. What's got him vexed enough to reenter the ring with his industrial-metal powerhouse? You guessed it: Donald Trump.&nbsp;""It just seems like we're right back in the same spot that I've been jabbering about for, like, 30 years,"" says Jourgensen, who dubbed the president ""Hurricane Cheeto"" after his remarkably catastrophic inaugural year. ""Here we go again. I have to do another anti-fascist record. Hello? Anybody out there?""The result is Ministry's upcoming 14th album,&nbsp;AmeriKKKant, due March 9th.&nbsp;Heavily informed by Eighties hip-hop, thrash and cable news, the new LP also boasts a new lineup â€“ featuring live scratcher DJ Swamp (Beck, the Crystal Method) and a guest appearance from founding N.W.A member Arabian Prince. At Ministry's recent NYC show, turntables merged with guitars while Jourgensen rallied the crowd, marching between two inflatable chickens designed in the image of Trump. He hopes to bring the chickens back on Ministry's North American tour next spring, alongside opener Chelsea Wolfe.""I'll tell you what,"" says Jourgensen, ""to detractors of Ministry, I promise you, I will stop making music. You just make it a nice little utopian world. All right? Then I'll shut the fuck up.""Given that you once released a song called ""70's Rock Must Die,"" I want to thank you for talking to Rolling Stone.Yeah. That was my, uh, little collaboration with Jello Biafra. I can't think of a more perfect person to write that song than Jello. I wrote the music to that, but he wrote the lyrics, which are hysterical.Jokes aside, tell me about your new album. How would you compare it to previous Ministry records?It's very different from most Ministry albums. I think the consensus [among] people who've heard it so far is basically that it sounds like ... well, ""Punk Floyd."" [Laughs] It's pretty ethereal, most of it. But then there's a couple of clunkers in there that are very reminiscent of Ministry's glory days, or whatever: ""Antifa,"" and ""Wargasm"" is another one that fits right into that realm. The rest of the album is pretty trippy. I think it will do really well in states with legal marijuana.This is your first Ministry album without Mike Scaccia. What was it like, working on new music without him? I mean, I don't go in there with any preconceived notions when I go into a studio. ... Basically the music flows through me&nbsp;as opposed to the other way around. I'm just going there and bashing out ideas. Some of them work, some of them don't. A lot of things have happened in my life over the last few years: I moved from Texas back to Los Angeles, I got divorced, Mikey died, and all this stuff. There was a lot of different emotions to tap into. We got some real rippers in there â€“ you think you're at a thrash concert, then the next minute you think somebody dosed your drink with some psychedelics. I mean there's no time in between songs; all the songs talk to each other. It's kind of like telling a narrative or story the whole way through.&nbsp;We had some problems with contract negotiations and this and that. ... The last time this happened was with the album&nbsp;Psalm 69, when we ran into some legal bullshit about seven months before it came out. But it finally got resolved, and [AmeriKKKant is] coming out this March.Psalm 69 turned 25 this year and also ranked number 80 on our 100 Greatest Metal Albums list. What are your feelings on that record today? I didn't like [Psalm 69] for a lot of years just because of the difficulty of making that record. It was a real pain in the ass. There's a lot of shit going on. But I guess if you're a mother and you have a difficult child, it doesn't mean you're going to be, like, ""I hate that kid forever"" because they caused you a lot of pain. My stance towards it has softened over the years. It took me years to learn that because it was a nightmare to make. A lot of that was internal band drama and substance abuse. But time heals all wounds, and now I can appreciate it. Now it can vote and drink and drive. You know, Land of Rape and Honey turned 30 this year too. My babies are growing up! Fuck, I'm getting really old.You've been critical of every president over the years â€“ isn't Trump just a symptom of everything else you've railed against?Trump is just one pimple on the rash. And I found that out while doing the three [George W.] Bush albums. By the last album I did, The Last Sucker, it was not just about Bush being a sucker â€“ he was an idiot, a puppet, a mouthpiece for of the powers that be. But I realized that I'm a sucker for getting so bent out of shape about Bush, because Bush was just one pimple in the rash. It's the same thing with Trump. He's detestable, of course, but how could anybody actually like this person? Unless you're in the top one percent of spoiled, rich, misogynist man-toddlers who are entitled to getting anything they wanted. I mean, Trump's in the new album, saying some stupid shit, but he's not the focal point. I'm basically holding up a mirror to society and saying, ""How have we allowed [ourselves] to be duped this way?""You address this in the new song ""Antifa."" It's hard to believe that people are stigmatizing anti-fascism and protest, given the horrific events of the 20th century.&nbsp; We're going back even further than the 20th&nbsp;century â€“ people are just now tearing down Confederate statues! I've seen a number of cycles within this generation alone. And this one I have to say is like the Sixties, only on steroids. The whole civil rights thing is up for debate, again. Roe v. Wade [was decided upon] in 1973 and we're still fighting just for women to choose what they want to do with their own bodies. I was cognizant of all that stuff that was going on in the Sixties â€“ I actually went to the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago and got tear-gassed when I was still a kid.I know it seems like I can't put out enough records, but by next week I could be doing like a triple box set on, like, sexual harassment in the workplace, which has been going on for years. Probably next record. I'm sad for the people who have had to go through it, but I'm happy to see people like Rose McGowan open up about shit like this. It's fucking enough.Say you were to make a record on sexual harassment â€“ who would be some of your dream collaborators?  Well, first of all I'd work with some female artists, who I admit I haven't really worked with. So there's a couple of bands right now that I'm into right now, like Savages and Chelsea Wolfe. Really good. Matter of fact, Chelsea Wolfe will be touring with us in the spring. So I'm looking forward to that.Let's talk about your collaborators on this record. How did you link up with DJ Swamp and Arabian Prince?  It's a weird story â€“ through a friend of a friend of a friend, at a party that I didn't even want to go to. I didn't know who was going to be there. One of those deals. I just got to talking to this guy and didn't know who he was â€“ turns out it was Arabian Prince from N.W.A. He appreciated a lot of stuff that I was doing and incorporated some of that into his style as well. We hit it off and he started scratching on the record while I was in the studio. Another friend of a friend later hooked me up with DJ Swamp, who mixes samples through the turntables, instead of just the keyboards. He was scratching onstage with us, on our tour with Death Grips. It's pretty cool that these worlds are merging together.The way you developed Ministry's music, both in the style and subject matter, seemed parallel to what was happening in hip-hop in the late Eighties and Nineties. Although you took a more metal route. We never really felt comfortable just doing metal. We played all the fast metal and we have a lot of friends in metal, of course, but we never felt like a metal or even industrial band. Just because I use sequencers and samples and shit like that? I mean, so does ZZ Top, but their name doesn't roll off your tongue when you think of an industrial band.&nbsp;I've just never really been comfortable with any tag that's been put on me. I just write what I write â€“ basically I'm more of a photographer than I am a musician. I just take snapshots of what's going on around me. Sometimes it's very metal and sometimes it's not. I started with a shitty Eighties pop record. It depends on what's happening at the time. I'm glad you brought up the pop record [With Sympathy] â€“ it's one of my favorites.  Some people like it, and good on them. It took me years to like stop loathing that album or distancing myself from it. It is what it is. I'm glad I did that record because then I realized [music] is not all it's cracked up to be. You're 21 ... you sign a record deal because they find you talented in some way, shape or form. And then as soon as you sign to them, they tell you exactly what to write in their image, who to work with, what to wear, what to do, you know. I did the best I could, living somebody else's dream. Would that be your least favorite phase of Ministry?  I don't think it was Ministry! I had songs written back then, which later wound up on Twitch and Land of Rape and Honey. We were doing those songs in like, 1982. And then we signed to that label and they said, ""No, none of that stuff's going on the record."" I really don't have anything to do with it, except for the fact that I executed it, and at the behest of other people. But my name's on it. So I do a meet-and-greet or something, and people will come in with these obscure bootlegs. And I'll sign everything â€“ but I will not sign that record. I started this new thing, like, just as a joke I put on the Internet one time â€“ I said, ""Don't bother bringing these records unless you've got a thousand bucks in your pocket â€“ I'm not going to sign that record."" Sure enough, somebody came by with a thousand dollars in twenties and asked me to sign it immediately. I donated the money to a charity event in Chicago called Rock for Kids. So now I occasionally get a thousand dollars and donate it to charity. That's the only way I'll sign it.Could you share your story of coming to this country as a Cuban refugee?  There's really not much to share. I was only two years old. I do kind of remember one of my first thoughts was actually being on that plane that got here with my grandmother. And I just remember feeling like something big was happening â€“ I had never been on a plane before and felt the tension. That's all I remember about Cuba at all. I was too young for the Che Guevara crap. And then of course, you know, all Cubans go to Miami, that's the place where they go to spawn [laughs].My mom remarried to an American, so I grew up very American and middle class in some suburbs outside of Chicago. I didn't really speak English until I was six. Once I got into the public school system, much like today, people were like, ""Speak American!"" I lost all my Spanish at that point ... I didn't really know the ins and outs. Someday I plan on going back [to Cuba] and visiting, maybe performing or something like that. But I wasn't brought up with people bitching about Castro or Batista or anything. I actually didn't know much about my heritage until I went to college and started reading about it. That's why I don't talk about it much â€“ because if you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, you shut the fuck up. A lot of immigrants and their children can relate to your experience. It's difficult to explain to others that, even though you assimilated into American culture, it doesn't mean that the person you were before is erased â€“ your perspective just gets more complex. Exactly. And when Obama [lifted] travel restrictions, some walls came down and lot of my political friends immediately wrote to me about Cuba. And I was like, ""No, I think I'll go to Cabo San Lucas and have some fucking margarita on the beach."" I don't just immediately want to go to Cuba, you know? I don't have to go back and find my DNA roots or something like that, because I generally find that when you do those things, you build it up in your mind as this big thing and you get disappointed. Cuba's got its own thing of course â€“ they got old Fifties cars and a different kind of government. But people are still people there, you know â€“ it's just like anywhere else.How do you relate to Cuba now, as a refugee who adopted anti-capitalist politics? It's interesting. I'm pro-justice. I think there are certain elements of capitalism or communism that work â€“ as with any government, if it doesn't make it fair and equal for most anyone, I won't agree with it. Money, money, money, money is all you talk about in capitalism â€“ and in communist countries, the state and blood and soil is all you talk about, romanticizing the motherland and that bullshit. I just think people should be able to aspire and achieve whatever they want to achieve. Whatever they're comfortable doing. You know what I'm saying? And I don't think the system we have here is set up for that, especially for people of color, for women. I just don't see justice in that. You quit heroin more than a decade ago. How do you feel now? Well, I still enjoy some imbibement to a certain degree, though certainly not at the pace that I used to. But I have not had any drugs, pharmaceutical or street drugs of any sort â€“ as of September, it's been 15 years drug-free. That was a good little anniversary for me. Basically I just smoke pot all day long. I've finally found my niche in the drug world. It apparently cures any kinds of pains and arthritis that I used to have. It's actually helped my ulcer because it helps me drink less and sleep at night, no anxiety. It's a miracle drug. It's funny that I'd never even smoked pot until I was 51. I mean heroin was my gateway drug â€“ I started out on heroin and went to pot. Pretty much like everything I've done in my life, it's bass ackwards. I start with a sellout little pop record, and wind up playing this metal monster. I'm just bass ackwards. That's it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,Rob Sheffield,2018-01-29T16:25:00.000Z,Grammys 2018: Why You Shouldn't Be Shocked That Bruno Mars Beat Kendrick Lamar,"grammys 2018, rob sheffield grammys",Rolling Stone,"Oh, wait â€“ you think the Grammy is supposed to go to the year's best album? That's sweet. Stay gold, Ponyboy. This has literally never been the way the Grammys worked and never will be, so stop chewing that sock pretending it's a cookie. Of course Bruno Mars beat Kendrick Lamar. Everybody knew he would. The Grammys are comedy gold, and giving Album of the Year to Bruno instead of Kendrick will go down in history as one of their all-time most hilarious gaffes. But it's part of the grand Grammy tradition. Album of the Year never goes to the year's best album. It always goes to some other album â€“ usually a damn good one â€“ so people act outraged for a few days, then nobody ever remembers again who won. That's how the Grammys roll.Bruno's shocker win capped off an extremely weird Grammy ceremony â€“ the kind of night where you keep bracing yourself for those seven ominous words, ""Please welcome back to the stage: Sting!"" Lorde was there, but she didn't get invited to perform solo, unlike all the male Album of the Year nominees. So she sat in the audience, wearing a Jenny Holzer poem sewn on the back of her dress. Meanwhile, the Grammys seemed eager to bring on literally any music performance that wasn't Lorde. Sting and Shaggy skanking through ""Englishman in New York""? Patti LuPone belting an Evita ballad? By the time Bruno Mars came up to accept Album of the Year, looking as confused as everyone else, it was already in the history books as one of the most bizarre Grammy nights ever.Most years, you watch the ceremony for the live music and ignore the actual awards. But that just wasn't possible this year, because the winners were so out of whack. Jay-Z and SZA got shut out; Kendrick lost all the non-rap categories. It reminded me of the Grammy ceremony in 1992 â€“ the year punk broke, when the air was full of grunge and gangsta rap â€“ except all the big awards went to Natalie Cole's ""Unforgettable,"" a duet with her dead father, on a song that was already 40 years old. Irving Gordon, the old-timer who wrote ""Unforgettable,"" had a funny line when he won that night. ""It's nice to have a middle-aged song do something,"" Gordon said. ""It's also nice to have a song accepted that you don't get a hernia when you sing it."" That's why Bruno won. He passes the hernia test. He not only made an excellent record, he made one with cross-generational appeal. Look, Grammy voters are old. There's no possible way this couldn't be the case, since Academy Members are people with long careers in the music biz. Lifers. Fans who cherish their memories of Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra, but can't recall their Netflix password. If you want the Grammys to reflect a younger demo, it'd be easier to start a whole new award than to magically change all the Academy members' birth certificates. The Grammys have never not been this way. The biggest-selling album of 1968 was Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced. Jimi not only failed to win Album of the Year (it went to Glen Campbell), he didn't get Best New Artist, which that year went to JosÃ© Feliciano. Jimi didn't get a single Grammy nomination in his lifetime. He had more commercial success than Glen or JosÃ©. He just didn't pass the hernia test.Flash back even earlier to 1966, the year rock albums exploded as an art form, with classics like Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde and Otis Redding's Dictionary of Soul and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Revolver. So who won Album of the Year? Frank Sinatra, for A Man and His Music. At least Revolver got nominated; the others got shut out. For the record, Frank beat Barbra Streisand's Color Me Barbra, Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass and the Dr. Zhivago soundtrack, all probably very nice but not exactly picks that stood the test of time. So you can't take the actual awards too seriously â€“ the trophies are just an excuse for a TV party full of live performances. No way should James Corden be hosting this show while LL Cool J is alive, but at least Corden had the sense to realize he was out of his depth, so he wisely shut up and stayed out of the way. (Except his ""Subway Karaoke"" bit with Sting and Shaggy, which was like a horrific cover verson of the old SNL ""Sting in an elevator"" sketch.) Cardi B set the tone for the whole night on the red carpet, when she told E!'s Giuliana Rancic, on live TV, ""I've got butterflies in my stomach and in my vagina.""Kendrick and Rihanna, looking like they were on their way to a My Chemical Romance gig in 2005, took the night's first award from Tony Bennett. (Tony gave them a double thumbs-up, a reminder that he's been an elder statesman schmoozing with youth since the Nineties, when he was always popping up on MTV to duet with Evan Dando or the Red Hot Chili Peppers.) Kendrick had just kicked off the show with his fiery Damn. medley, featuring U2 and Dave Chappelle, but he was typically gracious in his tribute to Rihanna: ""She came through and gassed me on my own record â€“ gassed me on my own song and whatnot, man."" Kendrick's speeches all night were pure poetry, as when he described what hip-hop means to him: ""It's really all about expressing yourself, putting that paint on that canvas for the world to evolve, for the next listener, for the next generation beyond that.""&nbsp;SZA belted a knockout version of ""Broken Clocks,"" her voice on fire with love galore. Little Big Town did ""Better Man,"" a great Taylor Swift song that would have fit right onto Red. Childish Gambino vamped through ""Redbone,"" starring the night's coolest drummer â€“ one of the show's few female instrumentalists. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee did a writhing-intensive ""Despacito"" that felt like a triumphant coronation; Justin Bieber helped by not showing up. Elton John sang ""Tiny Dancer"" with Miley Cyrus, although they both looked like they would have rather been ripping up ""The Bitch Is Back.""Gary Clark Jr. did a kick-ass tribute to Chuck Berry, featuring what might have been the night's only guitar solo â€“ the shot of Berry's son in the audience singing along with the rapid-fire verbal barrage of ""Maybellene"" was a touching reminder of what pure music love is all about. Even though guitar bands kept making artistic breakthroughs in 2017, the Grammys' interest in guitars has dwindled to the point where Dave Grohl can't get on the show â€“ even on a night when the Foo Fighters won a Grammy. The late Leonard Cohen won for Best Rock Performance (for ""You Want It Darker""), and nobody would have savored the bleak humor of that more than Cohen himself.Alessia Cara was a surprise winner for Best New Artist, since she's been on the come-up for a few years now â€“ ""Here"" was one of the finest pop singles of 2015. Sam Smith crooned ""Pray,"" because nothing says ""award-show bathroom break"" like a well-meaning and slightly dull crooner urging us all to pray more. (""Pray"" is what Bieber sang at the VMAs the year he went with Selena Gomez and brought a snake on their date, a red carpet catastrophe that will traumatize me unto the grave.) Kesha easily outdid him with her massive performance of ""Praying,"" backed with a sisterly choir that featured everyone from Cyndi Lauper to Camila Cabello â€“ one of the night's powerhouse emotional moments. Chris Stapleton and Emmylou Harris sang ""Wildflowers"" for the inevitable Tom Petty tribute. (You were expecting Sam Smith?) In a much less successful memorial, a few country stars â€“ Maren Morris, Eric Church and the Brothers Osborne â€“ got stuck with delivering a bungled tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas massacre, without ever being allowed to mention that guns were involved. They also had to sing an Eric Clapton hit, instead of the countless country songs about mourning the dead. (They should have done ""I Still Miss Someone,"" from Donnie Wahlberg's fave Johnny Cash.) Another dud: ""Wild Thoughts,"" where DJ Khaled sounded like a Long Island wedding DJ huffing and puffing along with Carlos Santana's ""Smooth,"" with absolutely no clue when it was time for him to just get out of Rihanna's damn way. It was as comical as that Mamma Mia 2 ad where Cher sang ""Fernando.""Camila Cabello did an eloquent introduction to U2's performance in front of the Statue of Liberty, a celebration of America's dreamers and immigration. Unfortunately, Camila didn't get to sing ""Havana,"" her own brilliant meditation on the immigrant diaspora. (No doubt Bono would have been honored to return the favor and introduce her.) Alas, the closest we got to a Camila performance was ""Never Be the Same"" â€“ the best song on her excellent new solo debut â€“ showing up in a shampoo ad.For the big moment at the end of the night, Bono and the Edge came out to present Album of the Year. It was 30 years ago they won it for The Joshua Tree (the night Bono used his speech to complain about not getting enough respect from the Village Voice critics). It would have felt poetic to see them pass the torch to Kendrick. But no, it didn't exactly work out that way. When Bruno won instead, he handled the moment gracefully, congratulating his fellow nominees and dedicating his award to Babyface, Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. It was a class move from a class act. Sure, everybody except the Grammy voters thought Kendrick made the best album of 2018 â€“ I thought so, you thought so. Rolling Stone thought so, every critics' poll thought so, your mom thought so, Kendrick's mom definitely thought so. Hell, even Bruno might think so. It was definitely a shocking moment. And yet somehow, that's what made it feel like just another chapter in a long-running Grammy tradition.&nbsp;Making people mad is what the Grammys are all about.Watch below:&nbsp;A recap of the best and worst moments of the 2018 Grammy Awards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,Sarah  Grant,2018-02-23T20:49:00.000Z,Lucy Dacus: Rock's Reluctant Hero ,lucy dacus,Rolling Stone,"A couple of years ago, Lucy Dacus was a 19-year-old indie-rock songwriter with a day job working in a Richmond, Virginia photo lab â€“ the kind of person who was happy to kill a Friday night by tucking into a Russian novel. So she needed to do some adjusting when her debut LP, 2016's No Burden, touched off a 20-plus-label bidding war and two years of constant touring. ""My sense of community was crippled,"" Dacus says on a recent afternoon, sitting on the bed of her quaint New York Airbnb. ""I wasn't talking to my friends, and I was interacting with fans who think they know me, but I know that they don't.""Even if somebody wanted to tell me what one of my songs meant to him or her, I can't do it â€“ I would be probably put to tears every time,"" she continues, flicking on a reading lamp that casts a shadow on her apple cheeks and thick brown hair. ""And I feel cold if I'm not able to get on the same level. I don't know how to combat that disparity."" If the starkly personal songs on No Burden inspired this weird sense of familiarity, her even-more-intense new album, Historian, isn't likely to alleviate the situation.One highlight is ""Night Shift,"" a seven-minute distortion-soaked ballad about her relationship with her former bassist, whom she dated for five years and broke up with the day after they finished touring for No Burden. ""I didn't realize how bad he was treating me until I realized how bad he was treating my band,"" she says.&nbsp;The rest of album is similarly cathartic, as&nbsp;the 22-year-old singer-songwriter tackles everything from the pitfalls of toxic relationships (""Addictions"") to coming to terms with mortality (""Next of Kin""). On ""Kin,"" Dacus sings about being ""Too deep inside my head/Too far outside my skin,"" a pattern of behavior she's trying to break out of. ""I think I've had extremes of being unable to exist outside of my own head, and then I only am existing for other people, â€_ There's a middle ground where I should take care of myself and other people. Writing the line is setting a goal for myself that I then have to achieve.""Dacus wrote ""Next of Kin"" last winter, after she experienced her first anxiety attack. (""My throat would close up, I would start losing my vision, get dizzy, get nauseous; I could tell myself, 'Nothing's going on, chill out,' but I'd just be shaking."") That trauma made her question her lifelong obsession with writing about her life in journals â€“ and eventually in songs. ""I don't know why I do it,"" she says. ""But it's an impulse that defines who I am.""Dacus grew up in rural Mechanicsburg, Virginia. (""Corn fields and goat farms and suburbs,"" she says.) Her parents are liberal, creative types who met through a mutual friend in community theater, and they shielded her from the religious dogma that engulfed the town.As a child, she combed her dad's CD collection for sustenance beyond musical theater and Christian rock, finding companionship in&nbsp;Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits (""I'm going to name my daughter Emily""), Led Zeppelin I and â€“ most importantly â€“ David Bowie. ""When I heard 'Five Years' I just started crying,"" she says. Years later, the song is still a significant influence. ""['Five Years'] is what got me started on this whole train of thought: How are you going to fit everything in one life? What's the most important?"" she wonders. ""The album itself, I hope, asks people to prioritize the things that make them content. And to be aware of, but not caught up in, the eventuality of death.""She explores that theme most poignantly on ""Historians."" ""I was contemplating just anyone in my life that I love dying,"" she explains, ""and what these efforts to capture them in journals or songs really amounts to.""Lately, Dacus has turned her attention to the idea of stability, perhaps as a reaction to her hectic life on tour. ""Having familiar facets of my life means so much more now,"" she says. She just bought a house in Richmond, and has been focused on weeding out the people in her life who don't make her happy.""If there are people who treat me wrong, I either talk to them about it or I don't talk to them anymore,"" she says. ""It's been the most thoughtful and considerate thing I could do for myself and other people. I am going to try to do that forever."" In fact, she says, she wrote a song about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,Jordan Runtagh,2018-02-22T13:50:00.000Z,Radiohead's 'Pablo Honey': 10 Things You Didn't Know,"radiohead, radiohead pablo",Rolling Stone,"The first major step in Radiohead's lengthy journey from Oxford club mainstays to globally lauded architects of contemporary art rock took the form of Pablo Honey, their debut LP, issued on February 22nd, 1993. While the album lacks the musical daring that characterized their later works, it finds the band wearing their influences openly, with a refreshing absence of self-consciousness. Glimmers of U2, the Cure, the Smiths and even the Who shine through, signs of Thom Yorke &amp; Co. struggling to assert their dour Britishness in a scene increasingly choked with grunge sounds wafting in from Seattle. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Pablo Honey is how undistinguished it sounds â€“ as if the band was simply trying to make songs rather than a major statement.Even though they railed against the very premise on ""Anyone Can Play Guitar,"" Pablo Honey sounds distinctly like the work of a bunch of guys who want to be rock stars. Their wish would be granted with ""Creep,"" the transatlantic smash which, for good or ill, eclipses everything else on the album. The song would be their free pass to the MTV age and beyond, and also their cross to bear. The band very nearly foundered trying to escape the mammoth success of ""Creep,"" but in doing so they redefined their creative goals. ""The second album is going to be much better than the first,"" Thom Yorke told Melody Maker not long after the release of Pablo Honey. ""The first one was quite flawed, and hopefully the new one will make more sense. I like the first album, but we were very naÃ¯ve. We didn't really know how to use the studio."" They would learn fast, leading to 1995's The Bends, beginning a creative run that has few rivals in modern rock.As Pablo Honey turns 25, here are 10 fascinating facts you might not know about Radiohead's debut album.1. The title comes from a Jerky Boys prank-call skit.In the early Nineties, fellow Thames Valley alt rockers Chapterhouse passed Radiohead a bootleg tape of prank phone calls that had been making the rounds in the New York comedy underground. It was the product of Johnny Brennan and Kamal Ahmed, two childhood friends from Queens who called themselves the Jerky Boys. Together they terrorized the Gotham area via telephone, pleading with unsuspecting piano tuners to help ""get my fuckin' dawg out from inside the piano ... he's a Rottweiler,"" urging strangers to ""fuck my wife up the ass,"" or doing battle with rigid receptionists. ""Some of it's really sick,"" Thom Yorke told Select in May 1993. ""Some of it I can't cope with. But the notion of phoning up people cold is so Nineties. It's just the ultimate sacrilege â€“ turn up in someone's life and they can't do anything about it."" One sketch that Radiohead found especially hilarious, in which one of the Jerkys posed as the confused victim's mother, opened with a feebly moaned, ""Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida."" The band decided to use the line when it came time to title their debut album. ""'Pablo Honey' was appropriate for us, being all mothers' boys,"" Yorke later joked. Radiohead also sampled the sketch during the guitar solo on the song ""How Do You,"" giving the mainstream public its first taste of the bit. The comedy duo would release it themselves the following year as the opening track on their platinum album, The Jerky Boys 2. 2. ""Stop Whispering"" is one of the oldest Radiohead songs, dating back to their days as On a Friday.Ed O'Brien once referred to Pablo Honey, with some derision, as ""a collection of our greatest hits as an unsigned band."" In fact, a number of tracks on the album date back to Radioheadâ€™s earlier incarnation, On a Friday, formed during their time as students at the Abingdon School in their native Oxfordshire. Named for the day they gathered to rehearse each week, the nascent group weathered a lengthy hiatus while they attended university to reconvene in 1991. That spring they recorded a three-track cassette at Dungeon Studios, which included ""Stop Whispering,"" a song written as a tribute to the Pixies (though they later admitted they missed the mark, landing somewhere in early U2 territory). O'Brien described the song in 1993 as being ""about people not standing up for their rights: Stop whispering and start shouting."" They liked it enough to record it for Pablo Honey, but re-recorded it yet again when it came time to release the song as a single in the United States. ""We were just never happy with the version on the album,"" O'Brien told Creem after it was issued in October 1993. ""For us, it kind of lost the plot. So we rerecorded it in a day and a half. It's more atmospheric now. Like a Joy Division from the late '70s, early '80s.""Radiohead pulled three more songs from their On a Fridayâ€“era back catalogue while recording Pablo Honey: ""You,"" ""I Can't,"" and ""Thinking About You."" These had first been recorded in October 1991 at Courtyard, a local studio belonging to the band's future manager, Chris Hufford. The five-song cassette was sold at an Oxford record shop called Manic Hedgehog, from which the demo took its unofficial name. Its simple, homemade cover insert depicts a childlike drawing, done by Yorke, of an alien head flanked by the words ""Work Sucks."" 3. Jonny Greenwood's aggressive guitar stabs in ""Creep"" were intended to ruin the song.The menacing guitar stabs that come just before the chorus of ""Creep"" are arguably the song's most memorable hook. They also came about spontaneously. When the band ran through the song at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, not far from their native Oxford, they had no idea the tape was rolling â€“ and Jonny Greenwood was just messing around. ""It was recorded while we were actually in the studio to record two other songs,"" he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1993. ""We were asked to play some things to check the levels of the tape, and we just did one that we liked best from rehearsing it the day before. We'd only written it the week before and we were just kind of very keen to play it for each other, and they happened to record it."" According to drummer Phil Selway, the surprise tactic paid dividends for the studio novices. ""When it was recorded, we didn't even know it was being taped â€“ we were just warming up for another track by it. The reason it sounds so powerful is because it's completely unselfconscious.""The mood was so light that Greenwood felt free to express his distaste for the song's serene intro. ""I didn't like it. It stayed quiet,"" he said later. ""So I hit the guitar hard â€“ really hard."" By slashing out a series of muffled dead notes, he created what was affectionately dubbed ""The Noise"" by the rest of the band. ""That's the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up,"" recalled Ed O'Brien. ""He really didn't like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song."" The distorted fuzz rudely burst into ""Creep"" unannounced, elbowing aside the fragile guitar arpeggio and Yorke's frail vocals in favor of the soaring chorus. The positive effect was immediately apparent, and the band ended the take by bursting into applause. That performance would ultimately form the basis of the final track, including the Noise. ""I heard from a couple very professional producers who expressed amazement that we left it in,"" co-producer Sean Slade told MTV in 2013. ""Of course, not only did we leave it in, but we made it so loud that it punched you in the face. And really, 'The Noise' has almost become as famous as the song itself.""4. Thom Yorke was persuaded to rewrite the first verse of ""Creep"" while recording a censored radio version.Once ""Creep"" was earmarked as Pablo Honey's lead single, EMI requested that Radiohead record a ""clean"" version for radio, eliminating the ""fucking"" in the second verse. The band initially thought that censoring themselves was, according to Jonny Greenwood, ""a bit of a sellout ... but then we thought, 'Sonic Youth has done it.' We thought it wouldn't be that bad."" Since Yorke was required back in the studio, co-producer Paul Q. Kolderie decided to come clean about something: He wasn't thrilled about a few of the lyrics.""When we first did 'Creep,' the first verse was different. I don't remember exactly what it was now, but it was not good lyrically, sort of stupid and funny,"" Kolderie recalled in Marc Randallâ€™s Exit Music: The Radiohead Story. Though the full text has been lost to time, ""shoulder of lamb, frying in a pan"" was apparently one memorable couplet. ""When we went back in [to record the censored version] I told Thom I thought that verse could be better, and at first he said, 'It's already written, I can't change it.' I said, 'Of course you can. Look, we're here to change these other words. We're going to record some vocals anyway. Come on, you can do better than that.'"" Yorke acquiesced, returning 10 minutes later with the lyrics heard on the final recording â€“ and a ""very"" to replace the offending ""fucking."" Over the years, Kolderie's admiration for Yorke's quick work has multiplied. ""Ever since then, I've tried to do that with other artists â€“ 'Hey man, why don't you just go in right now and make that better?' â€“ and I'll tell you, it's a rare person who can do it.""5. ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" features Jonny Greenwood whacking his six-string with a paintbrush. ""I never listened to guitar playing in any band, ever,"" Jonny Greenwood railed in 1998. It's a surprising sentiment coming from the man widely believed to be the six-string prodigy of Radiohead. ""Worshiping guitarists is all buying guitar magazines. Anybody can play guitar, but writing songs is a far harder challenge. I'd rather idolize someone like Elvis Costello than I would Steve Vai."" This egalitarian view is clear throughout ""Anyone Can Play Guitar,"" the second single released off Pablo Honey. The song deconstructs the myth of rock &amp; roll stardom, specifically taking aim at Jim Morrison, whose posthumous popularity had surged due to Oliver Stone's big budget 1991 biopic on the Doors. ""It's really just a series of thoughts about getting up onstage, making a brat of yourself and making a career out of it,"" Yorke said of the track in a 1993 interview with Melody Maker. ""I'm sure it was great to be Jim Morrison in 1968, but a lot of people can't relinquish these obsessions."" For any fans who may have missed the point, Yorke was even more blunt during an MTV performance that same year, following up the sarcastic line ""Maybe if I grow my hair I can become Jim Morrison"" by shouting ""Fat! Ugly! Dead!""While recording the song, Radiohead set about trying to prove the title in a very literal sense. ""We rounded up everyone in the studio,"" Kolderie says in Exit Music: The Radiohead Story. ""All five band members, Sean and I, the studio owner, the cook â€“ and gave each person a guitar. Everyone got assigned their own track, and they could do whatever they wanted. The idea was to live up to the title: anyone can play guitar. So they did, and we made it into a little sound collage at the beginning."" For added effect, Jonny Greenwood took a paintbrush to the strings of his Fender Telecaster. Favoring stylistic innovation over flashy shredding would become a hallmark of his playing throughout the band's career. ""I don't know any guitar scales,"" he insisted in a 1993 issue of Guitar. ""Well, I know one major one â€“ that's it â€“ and l just move up and down the neck depending on what modes I want. But you can get by with just chords. Rather than being able to play two thousand notes a minute, I can play an E chord anywhere on the neck and that's more interesting, I think."" 6. ""Thinking About You"" is Colin and Jonny Greenwood's mom's favorite track â€“ even though ""it was about wanking.""The Greenwood brothers took great pleasure in ribbing their staid mother by playing up their supposed life of rock &amp; roll debauchery. ""Jonathan often teases her about all the drug benders he goes on,"" Colin said in a 1995 interview with Select. ""And she sits there saying, 'Oh yes? How nice, dear.' It was funny, when we first got signed she wouldn't tell our grandfather what we were doing because she thought it would finish him off."" Despite her initial reservations, she gave their debut a perfunctory spin or two. ""She is quite proud of us, I suppose,"" says Jonny. ""Her favorite song on the first LP was 'Thinking About You' which has the line 'I'm playing with myself.' She had no idea it was about wanking.""The track, a gentle revision of their high-octane Drill EP song stripped down to double-tracked acoustic guitars and a fragile pump organ, isn't only about wanking. Unrequited love and loneliness are its true emotional focal points, underscored by Thom Yorke's anxieties towards romance â€“ born in part during his days at the all-male Abingdon School. ""I feel tremendous guilt for any sexual feelings I have, so I end up spending my entire life feeling sorry for fancying somebody,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1995. ""Even in school I thought girls were so wonderful that I was scared to death of them. I masturbate a lot. That's how I deal with it.""7. ""Creep"" got the band sued for sounding like a 1974 hit by the Hollies.The band initially referred to ""Creep"" as their ""Scott Walker song"" when they first debuted it for Kolderie and Slade during early sessions for Pablo Honey. Having misheard them, the producers spent a long stretch believing the tune was actually written by the baritone pop idol turned existential avant-garde troubadour. ""We walked out of the rehearsal that night and Sean said, 'Too bad their best song's a cover,'"" Kolderie recalled of the first time he heard the future hit. Though it was not a Walker original, the bridge for ""Creep"" did owe a sizable debt to an unlikely source: the catchy pop ditty ""The Boat That I Row."" Written by Albert Hammond (father of the Stokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr.) and Mike Hazlewood in 1972, its best-known version was recorded by the Hollies two years later, reaching the upper regions of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Rather than a straight steal, Radiohead intended it as an affectionate homage. ""What happened was, we wrote 'Creep', and the middle eighth just had ... my guitar playing a tune,"" Greenwood told Fender Frontline in 1993. ""And Ed stopped and said, 'This is the same chord sequence as that Hollies song,' and then sang it. So Thom copied it. It was funny to us in a way, sort of feeding something like that into [it]. It's a bit of change."" The publishers of ""The Air That I Breathe"" found it less than funny and filed a suit for copyright infringement, which was ultimately settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. As a result of the case, Hammond and Hazlewood now appear on the song's writing credits along with the band. ""Radiohead agreed that they had actually taken it from 'The Air That I Breathe,'"" Hammond said 2002. ""Because they were honest they weren't sued to the point of saying 'We want the whole thing.' So we ended up just getting a little piece of it.""8. The BBC banned ""Creep"" for being ""too depressing.""Despite their future status as favorites of the music press, Radiohead's early efforts failed to bowl over the critics. Following the release of ""Creep"" as a single in the fall of 1992, the NME described them as a ""pitiful, lily-livered excuse for a rock 'n' roll group,"" and intentionally ran an unflattering photo of Yorke captioned with the words ""ugly ugly ugly."" (He never forgot the slight, leading something of a grudge against the outlet.) The Los Angeles Times was more charitable, calling out the lengthy list of influences in their contemporary review. ""[The album] doesn't really deliver anything you haven't heard before, steering too close to Smiths-like melodies and trying ever so hard to be depressed in the way the Cure popularized,"" writes Mario Mundoz. As with the Hollies comparisons, the band was mostly in agreement with these characterizations. ""Heaven forbid anyone should judge us on Pablo Honey,"" Ed O'Brien told Select in 1997. ""We were in hock to Dinosaur Jr. and the Pixies up to our eyeballs."" Yet the most damning criticism wasn't leveled by a critic. BBC Radio One initially banned ""Creep""&nbsp;from its programming, reportedly deeming it too depressing. But once the song took off abroad, and after Radiohead recorded a censored version, the network reversed the decision.9. Beavis &amp; Butt-Head played a role in the success of ""Creep."" In addition to the band's videos earning regular rotation on MTV, Radiohead received an all-important endorsement from the channel's twin teen titans, Beavis &amp; Butt-Head. On an episode of Mike Judge's animated series that aired in early 1994, the duo sits around watching the clip for ""Creep."" At first, Butt-Head is not impressed by the placid guitar figure that opens the song. ""Don't worry Butthead,"" insists a knowing Beavis. ""It gets cool in a minute."" As the song shifts into the chorus, the bone-crushing power chords elicit joyful shrieks of ""Rock!"" from the boys. ""Beavis nearly comes, doesn't he?"" Jonny Greenwood laughed when recalling the clip in a May 1996 interview with Spin. The onscreen moment was particularly special for Yorke, a fan of the animated duo. Capitol Records, Radiohead's American imprint, also appreciated the gesture, and quickly milked it for a new ad campaign. ""They were doing 'I'm a Creep' contests and placing ads that said 'Beavis and Butt-Head Say They Don't Suck,' Kolderie remembered. The copy touting ""Oxford England's rowdiest band""&nbsp;even included a nod to Beavis and Butt-Head's trademark ""huh-huh-huh"" chuckle. The band would also appear in person on the network, making a memorable â€“ if bizarre â€“ showing on MTV's Beach House on July 4th, 1993. The pale, moody Englishmen look hopelessly miscast as a peroxide blonde Yorke wails the decidedly downbeat ""Creep"" and ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" surrounded by poolside revelers. He capped off the mini set by leaping into the pool, microphone and all, nearly electrocuting himself in the process. 10. The&nbsp;Bends track ""My Iron Long"" includes a resentful reference to ""Creep.""Like many newly famous acts, Radiohead quickly came to resent â€“ and even hate â€“ the very thing that vaulted them to superstardom. ""Creep"" had become a weight around their collective neck by the end of 1993, and the band's exhausting two-year touring schedule supporting Belly and PJ Harvey did little to soothe any nerves. ""There was a point where we seemed to be living out the same four-and-a-half minutes of our lives over and over again,"" Ed O'Brien told the Times in 1995. ""It was incredibly stultifying."" The pressure to escape the song, now contemptuously referred to as ""Crap,"" threatened to tear the group apart. ""It was frustrating, being judged on just that song when we felt we needed to move on,"" Yorke said in an interview with the Denver Post. ""We were forced on tour to support it, and it gagged us, really. We were on the verge of breaking up. It was a lesson. The way that modern music culture works is that bands get set in a period of time, and then they repeat that small moment of their lives forevermore â€“ that's what everybody wants. And that's just what we weren't going to do.""As far as the physically and emotionally exhausted Yorke was concerned, Radiohead had ""sucked Satan's cock"" and now the only choice was to push forward â€“ lest they be known as ""that 'Creep' band"" until the end of time. For months they struggled aimlessly in the studio, determined to best their previous work but unsure which direction to take. Band relations had reached their lowest point, but a brief tour helped clear their heads, and eventually the creative juices began to flow. One of the first new compositions to be written for their follow up to Pablo Honey was ""My Iron Lung,"" penned after the band cancelled their appearance at the Redding Festival due to Yorke's vocal problems. Recorded live at London's Astoria club (though the vocals were redone in a studio), the song seemed to reflect the singer's tenuous health as he compared Radiohead's biggest hit to the titular medical device that kept the group alive. ""This is our new song, just like the last one, a total waste of time,"" he snarls in the verse. By his own admission, Yorke intended ""My Iron Lung"" to finish ""Creep"" off for good, dubbing it ""the final nail"" in the song's coffin. ""But it just wasn't that at all,"" he told B-Side magazine. ""We released it because we found it very exciting when we listened to it."" Originally issued as the title track on their 1994 EP, it would be a standout on the Radiohead's next album, The Bends â€“ a musically dense and emotionally complex masterwork that erased their one-hit-wonder status forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,Will Hermes,2017-12-13T15:39:46.619Z, Why Sister Rosetta Tharpe Belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"sister rosetta tharpe, sister rosetta tharpe rock and roll hall of fame, rock and roll hall of fame, rosetta tharpe, sister rosetta tharpe video, who was sister rosetta tharpe",Rolling Stone,"Gripe all you like about deserving acts overlooked by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but no artist has been more overdue for recognition than Sister Rosetta Tharpe, whose induction into the Hall's ""Influences"" category was announced this morning. A queer black woman from Arkansas who shredded on electric guitar, belted praises both to God and secular pleasures, and broke the color line touring with white singers, she was gospel's first superstar, and she most assuredly rocked.Tharpe's first hit, in fact, was the transformed spiritual ""Rock Me,"" recorded with her soaring held notes and sexy growls back in 1938 â€“ when the latter-day King of Rock &amp; Roll, Elvis Presley, was still a toddler. Tharpe would later hire Grand Old Opry stars the Jordanaires to back her, years before they began working for Presley, who was her unabashed fan. ""Elvis loved Sister Rosetta,"" recalled the Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker, especially her ""incredible"" guitar style. ""That's what really attracted Elvis: her pickin'. He liked her singing, but he liked that pickin' first â€“ because it was so different.""Tharpe was an influence on other early rockers, too, including Chuck Berry. Later ones took note as well. ""Sister Rosetta Tharpe was anything but ordinary and plain,"" said Bob Dylan on his Theme Time Radio Hour show. ""She was a big, good-lookin woman, and divine, not to mention sublime and splendid. She was a powerful force of nature. A guitar-playin', singin' evangelist."" More recently, reigning country queen Miranda Lambert has been opening shows with an iconic clip of Tharpe performing ""Up Above My Head.""Born Rosetta Nubin in Cotton Plant, Arkansas in 1915, the young prodigy was performing gospel music with her mother at churches and revivals by age six, when the two moved north to Chicago. Tharpe's singing and guitar style developed with both rural and urban elements, which gave her a broad appeal. In her teens, she married a preacher, who she soon left, heading to New York CIty. There, she played with Duke Ellington and other top musicians. By her twenties, she'd hit her stride; after years working up north with swing bandleader Lucky Millinder, she toured the south with fellow gospel icons the Dixie Hummingbirds. In 1945, her jaunty single ""Strange Things Happening Every Day,"" with its hot guitar solo, was the first gospel single to cross over on the Billboard race charts.A year later, she met the singer Marie Knight. The pair recorded ""Up Above My Head,"" and set out to tour as a self-contained team: Knight sang and played piano; Tharpe sang and played both guitar and piano. They became lovers, an ""open secret,"" according to historian Gayle Wald, author of the essential biography Shout, Sister, Shout!&nbsp;Tharpe's relationship with Knight eventually faded, and in 1951 â€“ over two decades before Sly Stone thought to get hitched in Madison Square Garden â€“ Tharpe got married to her third husband in Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. The concert and promotional stunt drew 25,000, many with gifts.&nbsp;Tharpe's career waned over the next decade. In 1964, as the folk revival was cresting, she was booked for the Folk Blues and Gospel Caravan tour in England, and she played a famous gig in an abandoned railroad station that was broadcast nationwide by Granada television. It was a cold and rainy day, but Tharpe got out of a horse-drawn carriage like royalty, strode across the wet platform, picked up her electric guitar, plugged in, and played ""Didn't It Rain,"" electrical-shock risk apparently be damned, soloing and singing her heart out in front of a crowd of young people. ""I'm sure there are a lot of young English guys who picked up electric guitars after getting a look at her,"" Dylan said.&nbsp;Tharpe's career didn't get the same bump that male blues musicians did in the late Sixties and Seventies, no doubt in part because of her devotion to religious material. Her last known recording was in 1970, for Danish TV, singing the Thomas Dorsey gospel standard ""Take My Hand, Precious Lord,"" a song Elvis Presley had recorded, among many others. Tharpe died in 1973, in Philadelphia, where she'd been living with her mother in a modest home. The funeral was small; Marie Knight did her makeup and helped select her clothing for burial. Though her work has been largely forgotten, it's ripe for discovery. And as her induction should testify, the spirit of Sister Rosetta Tharpe is conjured every time a rock musician plugs in and aims for rapture. ""When you see Elvis Presley singing early in his career ... imagine he is channeling Sister Rosetta Tharpe,"" Wald has suggested. ""It's not an image I think we're used to thinking about when we think of rock &amp; roll history â€“ we don't think about the black woman behind the young white man.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,Michaelangelo Matos,2017-12-12T18:10:00.000Z,Shoom: An Oral History of the London Club That Kicked Off Rave Culture,"shoom, shoom club, danny rampling shoom, carl cox, paul oakenfold, terry farley, ibiza, danny rampling interview, shoom history, acid house",Rolling Stone,"In September 1987, four London club and pirate-radio DJs â€“ Nicky Holloway, Paul Oakenfold, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker â€“ spent a week on the Balearic island of Ibiza, a place where, legend had it, as journalist Chris Heath wrote in 1990, ""it was even possible to get drugs on room service."" The British quartet was visiting Trevor Fung and Ian St. Paul, with whom Oakenfold had thrown parties. Eventually, the group wound up at Amnesia, a large open-air space run by DJ Alfredo.&nbsp;Suddenly, this knot of MDMA-fueled English soul boys with few musical interests outside black American imports like go-go, funk, hip-hop and jazz-funk were suddenly grooving like mad to indie guitar bands and pop songs â€“ and especially to the minimalist house records coming from Chicago and bleep-y techno from Detroit, which didn't hew to pop-song structure but spoke fluently to bodies in motion. ""I could see their minds, their brains ticking overtime,"" St. Paul said in 2001. ""It was like Wacky Races â€“ who could get back quick enough to get it sorted.""Though Oakenfold threw Balearic-style parties both before and after the 1987 Ibiza trip â€“ he and St. Paul would start Future shortly after returning â€“ it was Rampling's Shoom that effectively kicked off the acid-house craze in London. Rampling's weekly began on December 5th, 1987, running on Saturdays in the basement of the Fitness Centre in Southwark, before moving first to a larger YMCA basement on Tottenham Court Road, and finally to Busby's in Charing Cross Road. Rampling shut Shoom down in early 1990. These were small venues: Rampling's then-wife, Jenni, guarded the door, picking and choosing the crowd with an iron will. She needed to, because thousands of punters were trying to get into a gym basement that held 300. Shoom was the crucial model for what would become the entire global rave scene, and therefore EDM culture as we know it. ""It wasn't just me, and my energy as a DJ, it was the enthusiasm from the crowd,"" Rampling tells Rolling Stone, looking back on the party's impact. ""Whether it be the Cavern [Club] with the Beatles or the Paradise Garage or the Warehouse in Chicago, it's a combination of the crowd and the music and the room and the vibe and the spirit of that room.""Rampling, along with Oakenfold and fellow London DJs Carl Cox (who played Shoom's opening night) and Terry Farley (a second-room resident at Shoom's YMCA location) spoke with RS about the wild, pivotal days of Shoom.I. PrehistoryCarl Cox: Danny Rampling was basically playing funk, soul and disco music at the time. I used to go and see him play at the local wine bars and pubs and certain funk and soul parties in the area. Danny Rampling: I was DJ'ing at parties and on pirate radio with Kiss FM â€“ a late-night slot, which was a real fortunate break. I worked with Nicky Holloway as his assistant. He was an established, leading club promoter in London. He did one-off events. I learned the business of promotion and how to set up an event.&nbsp;Terry Farley: In that time in London, if you looked at what was being played, musically, it was a real mishmash. DJs would play a Pharaoh Sanders record next to Run-D.M.C., and then a New York club record like ""D"" Train. The DJs were black music enthusiasts. We wouldn't play any records by white artists. The idea of a whole night of just house music being mixed wasn't in the scheme of things in London: ""Why would you want to do that? That means you can't play jazz records. It means you can't play hip-hop records.""Paul Oakenfold: I remember spending my money on an import Isley Brothers album and then having to dodge the landlord because I didn't have enough money to pay rent.&nbsp;Carl Cox: When I heard the first tune by Chip E. called ""Time to Jack,"" I was in. We never had a scene for that type of music in the UK. We had to create that scene.&nbsp;Paul Oakenfold: At that time I was dealing with Public Enemy, L.L. Cool J, Beastie Boys. I was always a fan of house music because I was playing it as a DJ. So I started to get more involved in that side of things. I was looking after DJ International and Trax Records, signing a lot of it to Champion. Steve ""Silk"" Hurley â€“ I promoted that record [""Jack Your Body,"" a U.K. Number One in January 1987] for London Records. It surprised everyone. Those records were bubbling under â€“ you knew one would break through, and that was the record.II. IbizaDanny Rampling: I'd been living in America for a year. I ended up in Florida. Toward the end of that trip a friend visited me from London. We had an accident on the wet roads of southern Florida. If it hadn't been for one of the roadside safety barriers, we both would have been dead. It really changed my outlook on life. I came back to England and Paul Oakenfold was having a birthday party in Ibiza. Nicky Holloway said, ""Would you like to come along as well?"" I said great, because I'd read about Amnesia, this after-hours club that goes at 3:30 or 4 in the morning, out in the open air, in The Face magazine.Terry Farley: The general idea people had of MDMA [was what] a famous pop star told me: ""It's brilliant, but you can't dance on it. It just makes your legs wobbly. All it does is make you want to sit down and hug people.""Paul Oakenfold: I knew of [DJ Alfredo] because I'd been there the year before and the year before that. The reason we got to know him personally is because I was promoting records. I would turn up with a bundle of records under my arm. One time, prior to that, I climbed over the wall with my buddy because we were desperate to get in. That was '87. That was before I had the promos in my hand. I used to sleep on the floor. I had half a loaf of bread everyday â€“ that was it. I had no money.Danny Rampling: Alfredo was a complete alchemist. He'd start with funky stuff â€“ hip-hop, Latin, pop, all sorts of music and genres â€“ and then as people came into the club, he'd pick it up and start to move into house and techno. Really, that was a complete revelation. We went there every night, and we all came back and decided to start our respective clubs.Terry Farley: It was only when people went to Ibiza [that anyone] said, ""There's hundreds of people and the energy they're getting off of each other fed back to all of the people, even the ones who didn't want to take drugs."" You just needed to be standing near people who were taking ecstasy, because you could still catch the vibe.III. ShoomDanny Rampling: I opened Shoom with my wife at the time, Jenni, at the Fitness Centre, which was a gymnasium during the week. I had played there at a private event three or four years before that. I had a strong inclination that I would be coming back to that room. The management remembered me and said, ""Yeah, you can host a night here. It's going to be 300 pounds."" It was every Saturday night from 11 till 5 in the morning.Carl Cox: Shoom was in a financial area. It's quite dead at night. So there was nobody complaining at all.&nbsp;Terry Farley: At that time, we all went to West End clubs. South of the river â€“ it was like someone dragging you from Manhattan to Queens to go to a nightclub. A lot of cabs didn't even want to go south of the river in London at that time. The streets were empty.Danny Rampling: The first guest was Carl Cox, who had a very good sound system. He came and did the opening night. He was giving me a bit of guidance. Certainly, I wasn't as skilled at mixing as he was at the time.Carl Cox: The first night of the doors opening at Shoom, half the crowd was there to hear funk and soul and disco music. Half the crowd turned up wearing disco gear â€“ Afro wigs, platform shoes, flares. They came down to boogie. They didn't come down to rage. So half the crowd was looking at the DJ going, ""What's this music?"" And the others were in dungarees and Day-Glo. It did take people a little while to adjust to the fact that that down-tempo music, that funk and soul, was behind us.Danny Rampling: The gym equipment was pushed to one side of the room, and then [covered by] a banner drape with Day-Glo paint and paintings of yellow smiley faces and ""Shoom"" painted onto it. The DJ console was set up in front of that banner. It did transpire years later that people were disappearing behind that bannered area and having, um, all kinds of fun â€“ a lot of intimate fun [laughs], unbeknown to me. The first official party was on December 5th.Terry Farley: You had two or three years of Chicago house music that had largely been ignored, that was there to be used. Suddenly, you could hear about 20 amazing records. Once you heard these records in the right way, suddenly it was a magical spark. Shoom definitely was for many the club that lit that spark.&nbsp;Carl Cox: You'd be there for the long-haul journey of it all. It wasn't about the big records; it was about the journey of the night and where it took you.&nbsp;Danny Rampling: I used to open with Barry White, ""Ecstasy"" [""It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me""], a very slow record. That would be the call to the dance floor. I would start at 95, 100 BPM, and then step it up to 105 BPM, 110, 115, and then into 115 to 120, the house sounds. Phuture's ""Acid Tracks"" â€“ the seminal acid track: that was rotated weekly. The signature tune for Shoom at the Fitness Centre was definitely the Nightwriters' ""Let the Music Use You,"" produced by Frankie Knuckles.Terry Farley: There were very small windows â€“ more like an air vent than an actual window â€“ onto the street. The smoke was coming out of the windows on the street, filling the street, which was lit up by these strobes. I remember pulling up in a taxi, and the whole street was looking like it was from a film set. So before I even got to the door of the club, we knew something exciting and different was happening.Carl Cox: There was a toilet, there was a bar â€“ end of story.&nbsp;Terry Farley: Within two minutes, you knew every person at that club as friends. When you went out in London before, the vast majority of people in the club, you didn't converse with. That wall completely went down with Shoom.The first time I got taken to Shoom was by a guy called Gary Haisman. He was the man behind D-Mob. He had a big pop hit with a record called ""We Call It Acieeed."" He was standing there screaming ""Acieeed!"" really loudly, which was quite frightening at first. It was very intense. I remember really liking the vibe. And then at the end they played the U2 record ""With or Without You."" Now, I hate U2. I fucking hate Bono with a vengeance. But it sounded absolutely amazing. Suddenly, my mind was opened: ""These records are brilliant!""&nbsp;I knew straightaway that this was completely different, and this was completely going to blow up massively. In fact, a lot of people were saying, ""Don't tell your friends. This is our thing. Keep it to yourself."" And the first thing we did, of course, was tell everyone we knew.IV. The Beginning of the EndDanny Rampling: The whole scene exploded within a matter of three or four months. Word had got out. People cottoned on that there was something pretty amazing and revolutionary happening. The first night there was 100 people. Within two months, there was 300 people. And within month four there was about 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 people queuing to get into a small basement space.&nbsp;One of the figureheads in the rave movement, Tony Colston-Hayter, came down to the club â€“ he was a professional gambler at the time, one of these eighties characters who had a brick-type mobile phone, good suits from Savile Row, public-school accent. Tony was greatly inspired by Shoom. He said to me, ""How about you come in as a partner? We're going to take this massive. You can make millions of pounds."" I said, ""Well, I don't really want to make millions of pounds, because what I've got in this club here is worth more than anything that money can buy to me.""&nbsp;Paul Oakenfold: He popped up about a year into it. He wanted to start doing the big raves. They were all the same â€“ without nitpicking and going, ""This stage is bigger"" or ""He had bigger lights,"" a rave's a rave.&nbsp;Danny Rampling: The rave scene was huge. They adopted the smiley face symbol at a lot of raves. But the raves got very dark. They completely bastardized it, ruined it. They took it the other way and it became very dark.&nbsp;After a year, we decided to move to a bigger venue. We moved to the Raw club, in the basement of a YMCA on Tottenham Court Road. It was a huge space. It held about 1,200 people. We moved there to a Thursday night. It was quite difficult logistically getting equipment in and out of the building. There was no lift; it's five flights of stairs down to this basement. Still, it was a good run.&nbsp;We moved from there to Busby's in Charing Cross Road, just across the block, which was adjacent to the Astoria Theatre, where all the bands play. The Astoria is also where Nicky Holloway [threw] the Trip. We had Busby's on a Wednesday night. It became very, very popular. That held about 1,100.&nbsp;Terry Farley: By the time Shoom had decided to bail out, there was a million nights in London copying that Ibiza book of rules.&nbsp;Danny Rampling: We closed Shoom because the rave scene had really deteriorated and become very dark and criminal gangs were running a lot of these events. It just became too much. Probably a bit like the Sixties â€“ people were losing their way, not looking after themselves. It was getting very messy. And I was being offered more work overseas. The rave scene helped that as well. London exploded â€“ not just London, but other cities around the U.K. exploded. There was something going on every night. People wanted to go out en masse, and they did, and it changed youth culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,David Chiu,2017-12-11T20:29:00.000Z,Chicago's Terry Kath: Inside the Life and Tragic Death of an Unsung Guitar Hero,"terry kath, terry kath film, terry kath documentary, terry kath gun, terry kath accident, terry kath chicago, michelle kath sinclair, chicago band, joe walsh, jimi hendrix",Rolling Stone,"Michelle Kath Sinclair still has a vivid memory of her father, original Chicago guitarist Terry Kath, who died nearly 40 years ago when she was only about two. She and her parents were traveling in a boat near a Wisconsin lodge owned by her grandparents. ""I was on my mom's lap,"" she tells Rolling Stone. ""[My father] was driving the boat and he said, 'Oh, we've got to turn around because the dam is up here.' We turned around, and that was the memory. I was totally questioning it for such a big portion of my life. I thought it was a dream. And my mom was like, 'No. That happened. I can't believe you remember that. You were probably five, six months old.'""Sinclair never really got to know her father, though his legend loomed large. In the early Seventies, Terry Kath contributed standout guitar work â€“ famously admired by Jimi Hendrix and other giants of the instrument â€“ and soulful vocal performances that were key features of Chicago's progressive jazz-rock sound. But at the peak of his career, on January 23rd, 1978, Kath died in a gun accident at the age of 31, a tragedy that effectively marked the end of Chicago's first successful era, and that still resonates with his friends and loved ones.To understand more about her father's life, Sinclair recently produced and directed a documentary on him, Chicago: The Terry Kath Experience.&nbsp;(Previously shown at film festivals and on AXS TV, the film comes out Tuesday on DVD, Blu-ray, Amazon, iTunes and other streaming platforms.) The project was born out of Sinclair's frustration that her father had been largely forgotten by a wider public. ""On one hand you have all these people saying, 'Oh, my God, this is the most amazing guitar player ever,'"" she explains, ""and on the other hand, you never see him recognized in the top 100 [guitarists] lists. I was inspired to expose his talents, like who he was as a guitar player, and to get him known more.""""Unfortunately, his guitar playing has been overlooked,"" Chicago trumpeter Lee Loughnane&nbsp;said in 2016, ""and probably because of being in such a large band, particularly a brass-oriented band. If Terry had been in a trio, he probably would have been right up there with Jimi Hendrix, who idolized Terry. He has still been with us in spirit all these years.""In addition to archival footage of Kath in performance and conversation, Sinclair's documentary includes new interviews with the original surviving members of Chicago â€“ Loughnane, Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Walt Parazaider, James Pankow, and Danny Seraphine â€“ along with the group's former producer/manager James William Guercio, and Kath's widow (and Sinclair's mom) Camelia. ""I think that for everyone, it was very much driven around the fact that they loved this guy,"" Sinclair says of her interviewees' participation in the film. ""Everything started out with how much my dad meant to them.""Also featured in the film describing Kath's talents are guitar heavyweights including ELO's Jeff Lynne, Toto's Steve Lukather, the Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell, Stone Temple Pilots' Dean DeLeo and Joe Walsh, a friend of Kath going back to when he was a member of the James Gang. ""He was a big guy,"" Walsh recalls. ""Your first thought was, 'Boy, I don't want him to be mad at me.' He was a great guy; he was a brilliant musician. He was a songwriter and a great singer. He was such a monster on guitar. He really didn't have any rules or boundaries. He studied all kinds of different styles. He would plug anything into anything and see what that did. He was just a total experimenter. And you can hear that in his records.""One key piece of Kath lore was when Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider after a Chicago gig at L.A.'s Whisky a Go Go that ""your guitar player is better than me."" ""They were opening up for Jimi Hendrix when they were still Chicago Transit Authority,"" says Sinclair. ""They spent a lot of time on the road together and apparently hung out a lot then. Guercio said that when they were at the same festivals, they had a nice relationship together.""With Chicago, Kath performed blazing guitar on such tracks as ""Introduction,"" ""Free Form Guitar,"" ""South California Purples,"" and ""Dialogue (Parts One and Two),"" while his deep, Ray Charlesâ€“like vocals were heard on tracks like ""Make Me Smile,"" ""Colour My World,"" and ""Little One."" Most recognizable is Kath's legendary guitar playing on Chicago's classic hit ""25 or 6 to 4,"" performed onstage as an extended solo showcase in contrast to the original studio version on the Chicago album. ""It's relentless from note one,"" says Walsh of Kath's performance on that song. ""Just to try and figure out what he's doing takes four or five days. To have the guts to do that on a song â€“ to play a [long] solo â€“ who does that? Maybe Carlos [Santana], but you don't play the same thing twice. How does he do that?""Aside from exploring his life in a hugely popular band, The Terry Kath Experience also delves into Kath's substance abuse and his ultimately fatal interest in guns. The film's emotional peak comes when Jerry Vaccarino, Chicago's road manager at the time, describes to Sinclair the tragic incident that killed her father. (While cleaning his firearms at the home of Don Johnson, an employee for Chicago, Kath accidentally fired a gun into his head after showing a concerned Johnson that the clip was empty â€“ not realizing that there was a bullet remaining in the chamber.) ""I remember just listening to him and thinking, 'Wow, no one has been this open and said it in this way,'"" Sinclair says of her conversation with Vaccarino. ""Almost everyone said that the last thing they ever expected was my dad to kill himself with a gun because they trusted him so much with guns.""Prior to the tragedy, Kath was working on his first solo record. ""I could only imagine what that would be,"" Sinclair says. ""I think that could've have been the thing that put him more on the map as a guitarist."" Adds Walsh: ""With that [band] dynamic [in Chicago], he needed to do a solo album. I don't know how much of it was recorded, but he was going in that direction. And it's a shame it didn't happen. He would have never remotely thought about suicide. That was a complete accident.""Chicago carried on after Kath's death, recording and touring with a number of guitarists throughout the years, among them Donnie Dacus, Chris Pinnick, Bill Champlin, Dawayne Bailey and, currently, Keith Howland. But Kath's memory lives on in the music (a collection of his notable performances were compiled for the 1997 album Chicago Presents the Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath), and most recently on Now More Than Ever, a documentary about Chicago. In 2016, Kath and the other founding Chicago members were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Sinclair was present at the festivities on behalf of her father. Footage from the ceremony was added to Sinclair's documentary at the last minute. ""It was important to stick it in there because I personally went on this mission to get him known, and here's the evidence,"" she says.""His part on the first couple of Chicago albums is all we have to work with,"" says Walsh of his late friend. ""It's a shame that young people never got a chance to see him live [onstage]. That's a whole different dimension. All we have to go on are the records he's made. He wrote a lot of it, he sang a bunch of it, and his guitar work is long forgotten. And that's a shame, because he was a complete monster [on guitar].""Ultimately Sinclair, who is a parent herself, explains that she and her production team were really focused on capturing her father's legacy through this project. ""If people want to go to listen to the music, I've done my job,"" she says. ""If you listen to the music, it's heavily driven by his sound. If you remove my dad from this song, you have a completely different song. I always found that quite fascinating. Hopefully people will go explore that a little bit more.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,Christopher R. Weingarten,2018-01-25T17:30:00.000Z,"Does Will.i.am Know the Future of Music? Black Eyed Peas on Tech, VR, Fergie",Black Eyed Peas,Rolling Stone,"The Black Eyed Peas practically disappeared after conquering the world in 2009 and following it up with a monster 2011. In that final year before going on hiatus, they played two of their three Number One singles at the Super Bowl halftime show, performed on four different continents, appeared on American Idol and Dancing With the Stars and even released their own video game for Wii and XBox. Though their EDM-tweaked sixth album, the The Beginning, had underperformed, there was no doubt that the Black Eyed Peas were one of the hugest pop groups in America.""We thought we were gonna come back in a year,"" explains Will.i.am. ""Then the year turned into two years. Then Taboo caught cancer like the flu â€“ and beat it â€“ and three years turned into four years, and four years turned in five years."" Though the three founding members â€“ Will.I.Am, Taboo and Apl.De.Ap â€“ reappeared briefly for 2015 nostalgic mash-up party ""Yesterday,"" this year sees the politically charged single ""Street Livin,'"" the first single from their ambitious project Masters of the Sun. (Longtime BEP singer Fergie was not involved.) Originally released last year as a 114-page afrofuturist graphic novel via Marvel Comics, there's also a musical component, virtual reality component, and an augmented reality experience featuring voicework from rap Avengers like KRS-One, Rakim, Queen Latifah, Common and more. Moreover, ""Street Livin'"" marks a swing from the group's chart-topping cosmopolitan boom-boom-pow into a more formalist, Nineties-style rap with modern flavors. Its lyrics detail systemic racism, police brutality, post-Reaganomics capitalism and more. It mirrors the humanitarian work the Peas have been doing behind the scenes for years: Will's I.Am.Angel Foundation helps Californian kids make it to college and supports robotics teams in Ferguson; the Apl.De.Ap Foundation builds schools in the Phillipines; Taboo has been loudly protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline and was given an MTV Video Music Award for his ""Stand Up / Stand N Rock #NoDAPL""Rolling Stone caught up with the Peas, who have returned to traverse the worlds of music, comic books, tech and politicsIn 2010, the Black Eyed Peas were a mix of pop, rap, R&amp;B and EDM. ""Street Livin'"" is a rap song in the way that KRS-One would define a rap song.Will.i.am: There's no chorus.What made you want to go that route?Will.i.am: We're scientists, we know how to make things for every occasion and this is the occasion of ""wake up,"" bombarded by numbskull-ness everyday when we're thumbing through life on our devices, and we need to make sure that we play our part to make sonics that reflect the work that we do in the community.You guys have been deep into social causes for years. What made you want to put it to music?Will.i.am: We wrote a whole bunch of songs. â€_Apl: We have ... over 100 songs.Will.i.am: And so, as we were finishing Masters of the Sun ... when we were scoring the worlds, you know, the mood of jazz, soul â€_ that was the mood. And so when we finished ""Street Livin'"", we're like ""Yo. â€_ Play that shit again. Yooo. You feel that shit?""The record company is like, [mocking voice] ""We really want the Black Eyed Peas super big, you know, you guys been gone for so long. We want to make sure we have big explosion with the Black Eyed Peas being back. You know, what I mean by explosion? Will, you guys are big pop group! You got the big pop songs!"" â€_ Like, nah nigga, we did that. Nah, this is what we're doing.It's almost like what you and Apl were doing with Atbann Klann in the early Nineties.Will.i.am: We kept saying, like ""What would our 17-year-old self think of where we're at now?"" So we'd try to outdo our 17-year-old self; when we were hungry and we was all about battling and rhyming and dancing and b-boying. ... So we said to ourselves, ""We gotta out-do every fuckin' line. It has to be better than the last line.""So now after [we] accomplished all the things you can possibly accomplish in the world of music industry, from Grammys to Super Bowls to World Cups and inaugurations. It's like alright guys, we went to outer space and shit, motherfuckers had space suits on. Chilling on Saturn's rings. I'm like, yo, bro, let's just come back down to Earth. It's kinda crazy down there right now. Everyone seems to be reading a lot into the fact that Fergie isn't on this song.Will.i.am: So there's a song that Black Eyed Peas did with De La Soul on Bridging the Gap (""Cali to New York""), it was just me and De La Soul. There's a song that we have [""Gone Going""] â€_ it was just me and Jack Johnson. There's a song called ""The Apl Song"" where it's just Apl. Ain't none of us on it. So that's the Black Eyed Peas. Is she still a member of the group?Apl: Fergie is family.Will.i.am: Family is family, right? So...Apl: Yeah, that don't ... never change.So, you do not care about making a hit record at this moment?Will.i.am: What's a hit record. though? â€_ After you've made those types of hits â€_ the industry isn't that [anymore]. When we had our hits it wasn't the way it was when Lionel Richie was making his hits. So the downgrading of just what a hit is financially. What is a hit? Now we have to invent.Apl: The way we were making it felt like going back to Behind the Front. It's that blind faith, but you feel good making it because it's like it's that same excitement again. Will.i.am: When we were doing those records, the record company, we needed their assistance, we had to go to a studio that that record company paid for. â€_ To do this project to be at our own facilities. In our facilities we have augmented reality guys and virtual reality folks all working on the project at the same time. And then our AI department that's doing all of our next-level voice operating system shits and then our sound stages and our recording studios all in this 60,000 square feet facility.And you guys own all of this?Yeah. Three hundred employees.This is where it gets tricky because the comic book has music, it has an augmented reality component, it has a virtual reality component. Is the music made to stand alone? Is it going to be a ""record""?Will.i.am: I think a ""record"" is limiting to things that you can accomplish today. Forever, you can always update the app.It's more than a comic book or an album or an augmented experience. What do you call the entire project?Will.i.am: Because it's the first â€_ there's no title for it. Imagine it's 1930 and somebody has a recorder and they take a Cadillac and they go down to freakin' New Orleans and somebody's like, ""Hey I wanna record you."" That person that's playing the blues is like, ""What are you fucking talking about? I don't even know what recording is."" Oh, I got this contraption, I'm going to record you.Imagine it's 1918 and Charlie Chaplin, the first time he seen the freakin' moving picture camera. They're used to just theatre, and opera singers are just used to just opera. The idea of movies, what the fuck is that? What the hell is a cinematic close up? What is that? People see the play from the audience, they never do a close-up shot. So new ways of telling stories had to be invented because of the technology. The same now. This compound sounds very Wonka-esque. What city is it in?Will.i.am: Our headquarters is in Los Angeles. We have offices here in New York for all of our home stuff ... home automation and intelligence. I.Am+ is like this cross-disciplinary creative factory that does everything from ...The fashion aspect, the tech aspect, the Venn-diagram of the two.Will.i.am: So fashion ... let's not go there. Fashion only because we are creating an operating system for wearable things. We're not making freakin' clothes and shit.Right, you're making wearable tech.Will.i.am: We're making an operating system for wearable tech. It's like ... an ink company isn't Rolling Stone. We just provide the fucking ink. So ... we're A.I. We're O.S., A.R., V.R ... and in studios; editing, recording, capturing both audio and visual. You really seem to love the technological revolution that we're going through right now.Will.i.am: 2018, a whole new industry is about to jump off. New careers, new jobs, new technologies, new ways of expressing yourself. â€_ You're in the house, you run out of soap, you say something like ""Abracadabra,"" fucking genie's in the bottle now. What we thought was fucking crazy with Aladdin that you say something like ""Abracadabra, shasazaram!"" and some motherfuckin' shit pops off and able to bring things to your home. That was myth 20 years ago. That's real now! Some wand where Harry Potter said ""Shazoomazips!"" We're not too far from being able to have some type of device â€“ you say something and out comes a result. And, that's exciting! That is the most disruptive, craziest place for creative people to actually create in.When you look at tech â€“ like Siri or Bitcoin â€“ do you think of it as an inevitability for society or more of an entrepreneurial opportunity?The thing that excited me about Siri is the backing thing that allows Siri to happen, and that's TTS [text-to-speech] natural language processing. Whatever the interface is, whatever the experience is, that backing interface ... that code, that algorithm ... that's what excites me. The potential of natural language understanding. Conversational computing. That's, like, of course, that's what everybody's gonna be doing. Is it gonna be Siri? Is it gonna be Alexa? Is it gonna be something else? That's not what excites me. What excites me is the tech to make that happen.It's almost like the way the Black Eyed Peas were on top of dance music before everyone else.Taboo: I mean, he's always like that. I mean, even with the app. He told us about this years ago because he gets an insight to what's coming.Will.i.am: In the beginning of [the video for 2010's] ""Imma Be Rocking That Body,"" I was on artificial intelligence.The video, if I would've watched that in 2010, I would've thought that was satirical.Will.i.am: No, that was always real, bro. Yeah, it's 'cause I knew that A.I. was coming.Taboo: No, he's serious, dude.Will.i.am: There's other things that's coming, like ... you know, the printing of protein. If you have a liver problem, kidney problem ... they're gonna print you new organs in the next 20 years. â€_ Impossible Burgers are delicious, bro ... it ain't meat. Where we're going, we've never been here before.Is there in anything in music happening right now that gets you excited in the same way, where you can hear it and say, ""Oh, this is clearly paving a way for the future?""Will.i.am: No. What's paving the way for the future of music ... is augmented reality and virtual reality. â€_ Right now in 2018, you're like, what's the future of music? Not music! There's always gonna be like, people are gonna push the boundaries on like, formats or song structure. What if I told you that today's popular music structure, no matter if it's underground hip-hop or underground rock, or pop, or whatever, it all is based on the limitations that record and vinyl had.  â€_ ""I've Been Workin' on the Railroad"" was a song they sung over and over and over and over and over again ... there was no time limit.That's why they thought they couldn't put rap on a record.Right, so here we are in 2018 and TV is still TV. â€_ A TV [show's] either 30 minutes long or 60 minutes long and the commercials that surround it are either 30 seconds long or 60 seconds long. So when you come to virtual reality and augmented reality, there are no boundaries yet. So that means for the art-form, you're freer as artists to think outside of these boundaries that the technology put around us.Records and vinyl. How long is a song? 3 minutes and 30 seconds? Oh, what a coinkydink, it just so happens that a song rotates in 33 degrees on a vinyl at 100 BPM or 98 BPM a minute. ... We already know the math. So. What is the future of music as far as how it progresses? I would bet that it's going to be virtual reality, augmented reality 'cause that's the true place for dreamers to dream up new shit. You can't dream the way it is because everyone's so conditioned to yesterday that even if you do abstract jazz, it's still the version of their version of doing it.If Michael Jackson was alive and Thriller just happened â€_ and virtual reality was out. He would be doing virtual reality right now. Think about it. He did ""Thriller"" and ""Billie Jean."" â€_ When there was hardly any music videos.And not many people had MTV. There are more virtual reality headsets in the world than there were people with MTV cable subscriptions. You know what I mean? â€_ It's an amazing time for somebody to try to do ""Thriller."" The hit for VR is gonna come.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,Richard Bienstock,2017-11-15T12:00:00.000Z,"Stone Temple Pilots Talk New Singer, Honoring Scott Weiland and Chester Bennington","stone temple pilots, stone temple pilots jeff gutt, jeff gutt, stone temple pilots new singer, chester bennington, scott weiland, stone temple pilots interview, robert deleo, dean deleo, eric kretz",Rolling Stone,"""It's Stone Temple Pilots time again,"" says Robert DeLeo, and judging by the band's gig at the Troubadour on Tuesday night, indeed it is. The long-running rock outfit, which also includes guitarist (and Robert's older brother) Dean DeLeo and drummer Eric Kretz, used the invite-only SiriusXM event at the legendary West Hollywood club as an opportunity to unveil new singer Jeff Gutt, who beat out roughly 15,000 hopefuls during an extended search that began more than a year ago. Gutt, a 41-year-old Michigan native who logged time in the early-2000s nu-metal act Dry Cell, among other bands, and more recently was a contestant on The X Factor, comes to the position having to fill some fairly large shoes â€“ singing songs first made famous by original Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and that in more recent years had been interpreted by Weiland's replacement, Linkin Park's Chester Bennington.&nbsp;When it came to finding someone to follow in those singers' footsteps, Dean says, ""We were not willing to settle. I mean, dude, think of the criteria that had to be filled here. You know, this is STP, man. So we would not settle. The fans deserve more than that.""	And Dean believes they have found a winner in Gutt, who came onto their radar rather late in their search. According to the guitarist, ""He was one of the last guys we saw, in the last two days of auditions. And that was just over a year ago â€“ September of 2016."" He continues, ""Jeff wasn't even part of the singer submissions. But Robert happened to be playing a gig with the Hollywood Vampires&nbsp;in Michigan and somebody came backstage after the show and approached him and said, 'You should check this guy out. He's a local guy.' And Robert called me the next morning and was like, 'Hey, man ...'""  Just a few months later, Gutt was the new singer of Stone Temple Pilots. But first, there was the audition process. After paring down the initial 15,000 or so submissions to under 50 hopefuls, the band set up shop at a recording and rehearsal studio and brought in each candidate to jam on some STP tunes. ""We did a week of auditions over at Studio 606 in the Valley,"" Kretz says. ""Three people a day, seven songs with each guy. And the songs we gave people had a really big range, from something like 'Interstate Love Song,' which is not a hard-hitting one to sing, to things like 'Dead &amp; Bloated.'""""These poor guys,"" Dean adds with a laugh. ""It went from 'Big Empty' to 'Piece of Pie,' where you've gotta get up to an A, to 'Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart,' which is a mouthful."" ""But Jeff came in and did a fantastic job,"" Kretz says.Recalls Gutt, ""I came in and I picked the hardest song first, which was 'Piece of Pie.' There's not a lot of space to breathe in that song. But I figured, 'If I get past this one I'll be good.' And one thing I remember is that the microphone was turned up really loud from the guy before me, and when I grabbed it the monitors just started screaming. It was pretty insane.""For Gutt, it was also surreal. ""I was probably 16 or 17 when Core came out,"" he says, ""and I just remember how Scott could cater to the song and create these characters. That blew me away. I was really studying singers at the time and Scott was at the top of the list. So walking in on that first day, it was crazy. I mean, you have dreams about things like this. I still feel a little Mark Wahlbergâ€“ish."" ""Mr. Weiland paved quite a way. Because not just anybody can sing this catalog."" â€“Dean DeLeo&nbsp;""You know,"" adds Dean, ""Mr. Weiland paved quite a way. Because not just anybody can sing this catalog. You need someone who really knows how to sing. And Jeff kind of has it all, man. He has that baritone, and he's also able to get into that tenor world. He's a real singer.""But while Gutt has proven more than capable of tackling the classic material, the band members also stress he wasn't brought in solely to lead a nostalgia trip. In fact, by the time STP welcomed Gutt onboard, the band was already several songs deep into new material. And as much as they wanted to find a singer, they also wanted a collaborator. ""Most of the time we've spent together has been in writing new material,"" Kretz says. ""And Jeff was taking the new songs and coming up with stuff right away. To use a baseball analogy, we kept throwing fastballs at him and he just kept hitting 'em. It was pretty exciting.""""The first time [we got together], we went to Robert's house and we brought Jeff down and he was just singing these melodies,"" Dean recalls. ""And I think he did all six songs that first day. That's a lot of songs. Like, wow, man."" Among those songs is ""Meadow,"" a churning hard rocker that Rolling Stone is premiering today. ""That was one of the ones that came earlier on in the process,"" Gutt says. ""It was one of the first songs we did."" Adds Kretz, ""It sounds like STP. It has all the elements. It's modern but still has that classic sound. So it kind of jumped out at us as a good representation.""And there's a lot more to come. The band recently wrapped recording on their seventh full-length studio album and first since 2010 (they also released an EP, High Rise, with Bennington in 2013). The new effort, as yet untitled, was produced by the band members themselves and is currently being mixed by Failure's Ken Andrews for a spring 2018 release.	For Kretz and the DeLeos, the road to this moment has been a long one, filled with inconceivable triumph and tragedy. Their debut, Core, remains one of the pillars of the early-Nineties alt-rock and grunge boom, selling more than 8 million copies to date, and the 1994 follow-up, Purple, debuted at Number One and moved another 6 million units. Throughout the rest of the decade the band racked up a string of hit singles and sold-out tours. All the while, they slowly began to disintegrate from the inside out, as Weiland grappled with an ongoing drug addiction that led to arrests and extended hiatuses from the band.&nbsp;After splitting with the singer for good in 2013, they picked up the pieces and regrouped with Bennington. ""That really injected us with exactly what we needed at the time,"" Dean says. ""Because we were at a low point, man."" Then, in December of 2015, Weiland, still estranged from his former band, was found dead on his tour bus from an accidental drug overdose; by that time, Bennington had left STP as well, albeit on friendly terms, in order to focus primarily on Linkin Park. In July of this year, the 41-year-old Bennington took his own life while at home in California.	It's clear from speaking with the surviving members that they're still raw in regard to the losses of their two previous singers. And the audition process only served to heighten some of those emotions. Hearing so many hopefuls attempting to tackle the old material, Dean says, was a ""reminder of the brilliance of Scott."" When asked about Bennington, he can only add, ""That guy was an angel, man. Just an angel."" ""Having two people that we've intimately shared so much with, and knowing they're gone, it's sad."" â€“Robert DeLeo&nbsp;""Having two people that we've intimately shared so much with, and knowing they're gone, it's sad,"" Robert says. ""It's very sad. It's not the way that I thought things were going to go in life.""	In Kretz's estimation, one way to honor Weiland and Bennington's memories is by playing the music they made together, but another is with the music that is still to come. ""I think it was important to us that we have a lot of new material going forward, in order to make it real again,"" he says. ""Because if it was just about chasing the catalog, that would be the easy way to go. There wouldn't be much substance to that. The fact that we recorded all these new songs, it ties into helping us heal from the losses of Scott and Chester. Because the catalog will always be there. But if the new music really excites us and excites the fans it has much more of a meaning as far as honoring what Scott and Chester brought to this as well.""Furthermore, when it comes down to it, Robert says, ""I think there's still Stone Temple Pilots music to be made. And between Dean and Eric and myself, we know each other so well at this point that it's the kind of thing where, when you're away from it, you don't really think about it. But then when you play together you regain a certain respect for what each one of us does individually, and as a trio musically. That thankful attitude and the gratitude toward being able to make music together is really a special thing.""He continues. ""We're not gonna be around forever, you know? So we just want to be making music. And we want Jeff to be a part of that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,Andy Greene,2018-02-15T19:26:00.000Z,"Matt Bellamy on Muse's Rousing, Political New Song 'Thought Contagion'","Muse, Matt Bellamy interview, Thought Contagion, Thought Contagion Video",Rolling Stone,"Muse&nbsp;is&nbsp;nowhere near finished recording their eighth album, but today they gave a preview of what's to come by releasing ""Thought Contagion."" The politically charged rock song is the second single from their as-yet-untitled LP after ""Dig Down,"" which came out last year.&nbsp;Dropping singles piecemeal like that is a radical departure from the group's standard practice of holding back any music until the album is complete. But nearly a quarter-century into their career, the trio are shaking up the process. ""It's nice to have that sort of quick turnaround rather than waiting for all the materials to come out with the album,"" Muse singer Matt Bellamy tells Rolling Stone. ""The album will be a very mixed bag. The songs are going to be quite different in spots and we're also interested in doing some genre-blending and era-blending.""Before releasing ""Thought Contagion,"" Bellamy opened up about his frustration with news in the Trump era, headlining Bonnaroo the day before his birthday and why he thinks the new Muse album will be their strongest.What's the backstory of ""Thought Contagion""?It's a pretty recent track, probably towards the end of last year is when I wrote it. I came up with the bass line and then I used a theremin, originally, to [create] this lead melody that went over the top. It wasn't until we started recording the song in November that it occurred to me that the theremin melody would be a cool, anthemic sort of vocal part, so [bassist] Chris [Wolstenholme] and I did about ten passes on that to create this sort of crowd effect on the vocal. The verse of the song, originally, was probably a lot more heavy-sounding than it is now, in terms of [having a] much more arena sound, drum kit kind of thing. But we wanted to experiment with programming the verse and go for more of a slightly trap or 808 drum feel for the verses, which took the song in a bit of a different journey.&nbsp;What inspired the lyrics? Lines like ""It's too late for the revolution/ Brace for the final solution"" really stood out to me.Probably watching American news stations. We're living in an age where these sort of ideologies, people's belief systems, whether they are true or false, are getting a lot of air time, especially ones on the false side. I think that we're living in an unusual period where a lot of airtime is being given to crazy ideas. The flip side is that we're living in a time where pointing out someone's inaccuracies, using science for example, is becoming increasingly difficult. Sometimes it's even perceived as an insensitive thing to do. The verses are me streaming off anxieties and feelings, which in the course of the song, I'm wondering whether they're actually mine or not. I don't know to what extent I'm influenced by others. Sometimes your anxieties about the world or your anxieties about the world of the future can be lessened by turning the news off and turning your phone off for a few days. You then realize that everything is fine. The key line in the song is: ""You've been bitten by a true believer/ You're been bitten by someone who is hungrier than you/ You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs."" That summarizes what I'm trying to get at here, which is sometimes in life you will come across situations where someone who is a bit idealogical or believes things that are not true in any way will sometimes have more power than you, over you or get more airtime. I think that's really what the song is about. It's about how other people's false belief systems can infect your own and sometimes even affect your feelings.Are ""Thought Contagion"" and ""Dig Down"" slated for the next album or are they standalone singles?All the songs we're putting out we will put on the next album. We're about halfway through the album process and we're pretty sure we'll get it done by the fall. We're either going to put it out in fall or early next year, but we're hoping to put another two singles out ahead of that.It's a very different approach than what you've done in the past, almost like what band's did in the 1960s. Why the change?Yeah. It also reminds of what it was like when the band first started where you're thinking about just one great song rather than thinking about a whole album. For us, it's really refreshing to just work on one song at a time and take each song to completion. We're doing the writing, recording and mixing process and even the video in this occasion before moving onto the next song. It's nice for us to not be multitasking twelve songs at once and always thinking about the whole. I think for the last two or three albums, we've always been thinking about the whole. ""What's the concept? What are the themes? What's the sound? What are the textures we're going to focus on for this album?"" It was nice to remind ourselves to just think about a song. What makes a song great? Every song you're going to hear over the next year will be totally unique with their sound, approach, textures and so on.You're playing a bunch of festival dates in the coming months. Are you going to fill in the gaps in the schedule with regular shows?This year, we're just doing about four or five shows. That's really to keep our energy up and take that energy into the studio. It's really just a year to make new music, basically, and we're just doing these shows to keep ourselves fresh and remind ourselves what the live show is and maybe a bit of that will come into the album process. Next year, when the album comes out, we'll do our own headlining world tour of some kind.Who is producing the album?It's going to be a mixed bag. We did ""Dig Down"" with Mike Elizondo and ""Thought Contagion"" was with Rich Costey. We might do a couple of more songs with either of those two and we're going to look at other producers for some new material pretty soon.&nbsp;That Shepherd's Bush ""By Request"" show you did late last year seemed like a lot of fun. What was it like to play songs like ""Butterflies and Hurricanes,"" things you haven't touched in years?It was really great. I was particularly fascinated by some of the songs they requested. Some of them were so old and strange. Half the songs were B-sides that weren't even on the albums. The one that surprised me most was a song called ""Easily."" The reaction that it got was amazing. It felt good since we'd never even played that song live before.&nbsp;You should do something like that in America.We'd like to do that. We always forget how long we've been going. In my mind, I always see the States as somewhere that we kind of came to after Europe. I don't always think how much time we've been touring the States. The first albums didn't come out there. It wasn't until the third album where we felt like we were starting out in the U.S.&nbsp;Are you looking forward to Bonnaroo?Totally. I'm over the moon about that. It's the day before my birthday, so I'll be celebrating onstage.Some fans are going to see this singles approach and think that you're not as committed to the idea of albums as you used to be.That isn't the case.&nbsp;It's a different approach. If anything, what we're going to wind up with here is an album where all the songs are going to be better. It remains to be seen whether the whole will have a concept to it, but I kinda think that we've done two or three concept albums in a row now. I think it'll be our greatest album in terms of the quality of individual songs.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,Elias Leight,2017-10-31T14:41:21.118Z,A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie: Lovestruck Bronx Rapper Wants to Be Your Mirror,"A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie The Bigger Artist, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie Drowning",Rolling Stone,"""Let's say you [are] going through something, and you tell me about it,"" says Bronx rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, sitting in a conference room at Atlantic Records, the hood of his Nike jacket pulled tightly around his head and a half-empty Red Bull in hand. ""I would make a song on some vicarious shit and make you feel like that's you that made that song. I want you to feel like, 'Damn, this is everything that I just went through.'""This step-into-the-listener's-shoes approach to his Auto-Tune-smeared hip-hop has worked wonders for A Boogie. In just 18 months, the rapper has launched 10 tracks onto the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart â€“ including ""Drowning,"" a Top 40 crossover collaboration with the syllable-swallowing MC Kodak Black â€“ and earned a major label deal that led to his Top Five debut, The Bigger Artist.""When A Boogie dropped Artist [his 2016 debut mixtape], he got my attention fully,"" says Cardo, a producer who's helmed tracks for Kendrick Lamar and Drake, and is also behind The Bigger Artist opener ""No Promises."" ""He's young, he's fly, he can rap, he can sing, he has that star power. Him and [A Boogie's label-mate] Don Q, they're like Method Man and Redman. I see him becoming a household name. He's very melodic, but he sounds like himself. And he sounds like he's from New York.""Though A Boogie's New York roots were likely important in gaining early radio support from major stations like Hot 97, it actually took a move away from the city to set the rapper on the path towards stardom. ""My mom and my dad moved to Florida first,"" he explains. ""I was in New York, I got in trouble a few times â€“ just regular little weed charges and shit. They were like, 'It's over, you gotta come with us.'"" While in Florida, A Boogie met Mr. Whyte, a producer who showed him the inside of his first professional studio. ""I used to record songs like, play the beat from one phone and have another phone recording me and just rap,"" A Boogie says. ""Moving from that to a studio was like, 'Damn, I never knew I could sound like this.' It was just magic.""Soon after finishing high school, A Boogie returned to New York ""ready to take on this music shit,"" and a messy romantic entanglement led to his debut mixtape, Artist. ""I made a whole tape about the shit, and it spread,"" the rapper says. He believes that bitterly heartbroken songs like ""Still Think About You"" (""Even if you feel like you really love her/Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her/'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing"") made him an outlier. ""People from where I come from, they don't make love songs,"" A Boogie says. ""Not everyone's really got the heart to talk about what's going on with their love in their music."" But Artist also included songs like ""My Shit,"" a gleeful track about the first rush of fame (""Now every time they play this song she say, 'This is my shit!'"") that were more likely to nab radio programmers. ""My Shit"" became A Boogie's first platinum record. ""Some of my songs are turnt up,"" A Boogie acknowledges, ""but that's just 'cause I have to make 'em like that so the clubs can play them.""There are songs for the clubs on The Bigger Artist too: ""Say A"" is jaunty and carefree while ""Somebody"" features a stony, floor-shaking beat from DJ Mustard. But the chilling numbers are often the most bracing. ""Stalking You"" is quiet â€“ almost beatless â€“ and disquieting, a creepy number about romance in the social media era. When A Boogie calls on one of hip-hop's current kings of bombast, producer Metro Boomin, for ""Get to You,"" the result is startlingly somber, an emotional gut-punch about the corrosive effects of jealousy. ""People [are] not used to Metro on a love song,"" A Boogie says happily. Though he's happy with debuting at Number Four on Billboard's albums chart, A Boogie admits he hoped to reach the 100,000 albums threshold in his opening week instead of topped out at 67,000 units. ""It's been a long time since this type of music has been really noticed,"" the rapper acknowledges. ""Hopefully people notice it as much I want them too. Everybody should start listening to love songs.""&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,Kory Grow,2017-11-01T17:02:22.498Z,"Bruce Dickinson on Life in and Out of Iron Maiden, Surviving Cancer","bruce dickinson,bruce dickinson interview,bruce dickinson book,iron maiden,iron maiden interview,what does this button do,bruce dickinson cancer,bruce dickinson quit,iron maiden singer,iron maiden history",Rolling Stone,"""I don't really read autobiographies,"" says Bruce Dickinson, the Iron Maiden frontman and solo artist who just happens to be promoting his own memoirs. ""So when I decided to write my own, I sampled a few â€“ as in, going to a bookstore, not buying the book and opening at random and going, 'OK, this reads like a shopping list.' 'OK, this is self-centered and boring.' You go through these celebrity biographies and you think, 'God, shallow' and, 'This is a bit desperate.'""Luckily for Dickinson, he has enough of a sense of humor about himself to make his book, What Does This Button Do?, both insightful and entertaining. Throughout, he interweaves stories of Iron Maiden's glory and playing solo shows in war-torn Sarajevo with tales of recovering from falling off stages. He offers glimpses into his offstage life, whether it's fencing, piloting 757s, hosting a radio show or writing novels and screenplays â€“ all with the requisite tales of bumps, scrapes, hurt feelings and terrifying engine malfunctions. And, in the book's longest chapter, he opens up about the battle with cancer that nearly sidelined his singing career.For at least the past decade, he says, people have begged him to write his memoirs, but he's resisted. ""It's a bit early,"" he says. ""I'm not done yet."" He changed his mind about writing a book after he got cancer. ""When I got done with it, finished, clear of it, I thought, 'This is probably nature's cattle prod to go,'"" he says. ""It's actually not a bad end point for a book â€“ not that I'm planning on checking out anytime soon. It's the beginning of a whole new chapter of the rest of your life. So I thought, because I've got an end, the beginning is pretty easy."" So he started writing out his story in college-ruled notebooks.Today, Dickinson is seated in an otherwise unremarkable conference room in his book publisher's office, high up in a Manhattan skyscraper. Copies of his book sit on a glass table next to his porridge, which he waits to eat until after the interview. As he speaks, he leans back and makes eye contact, looking relaxed in a way that suggests he has nothing to hide but still with the same intensity he projects while leaping around arena stages, commanding audiences to ""Scream for me!"" And despite his energy, when he looks back on his life so far with Rolling Stone, he's in a reflective mood.What sorts of ground rules did you give yourself when you began writing? I'm quite happy to reveal things about myself, but it's not my business nor is it moral to reveal things about other people that they wouldn't be willing to reveal about themselves. It's not their book. In a similar vein, I left out wives, children, divorce since it's not their book in a sense. Because you're a celebrity, whether you like it or not, whatever you say in a book, impinges massively on other people. I don't need to indulge in the salacious stuff or tittle-tattle. There's no point - it's not [MÃ¶tley CrÃ_e's memoir] The Dirt.Does it feel strange to you to write about your early girlfriends but not your wife? I think if you throw marriages and things like that in, you automatically have to throw in divorces and all the rest of it. It's part of your life, but not part of your life that's any relevance to other people. I think you open a big can of worms there, which I don't see as any point in doing. The point of the book is to tell some great stories.When you wrote about your childhood, you mentioned that you were bullied for being short. What strikes you when you look back on your life and how that shaped you? [Pauses]&nbsp;I've spent my whole life forgetting that I'm five foot six, posing for photos like, ""Make sure you get the half in"" [laughs]. And the thing about fights is that you come up with a kind of morality. You fight to defend what you think is right, and you don't fight for the hell of it. I'm not very fond of aggressive people that take up too much space in bars. I spent an awful lot of my time at school having bossed up some people like that, for calling them out and saying, ""You're an asshole."" You shouldn't say things like that, but you just do. My son's got himself into so much trouble for telling the truth about people. I'm like, ""You can't say that, even if it's true."" He's like, ""Why not?"" I say, ""It's complicated."" It's part of growing up.On that note, in the book, you address some of the times when you shot your mouth off, namely when you said Iron Maiden were better than Metallica. What do you think about things like this now? Look, I'm acutely conscious that when you say things in print, people are going to pick up on things. The stuff about Metallica, quite frankly, was a really good windup. We have a great relationship with Metallica. It wasn't aimed at Metallica. It was aimed at the rest of the world to say, ""We're back and we mean it. We mean it so much that we're going to say something pretty outrageous, so why don't you come to the show and find out. We dare you."" It's throwing down the gauntlet, and I'm the lead singer. It's my job. It's what I do.So is it arrogant? Uh, yeah. You're the lead singer of Iron Maiden, and you're going to be arrogant every now and again, because it kind of goes with the territory, yeah. Mick Jagger, is he arrogant? Yeah, probably â€“ it's Mick Jagger, for fuck's sake. Do I make a distinction between me walking down the street and me onstage with Iron Maiden? Yeah. How would you describe that, the difference between being onstage and off?It's like you have a little internal balloon. Normally, you walk around and it's in the little flaccid deflated state inside your head, and nobody sees it. When you walk out on that stage, you have to inflate that balloon, and it has to touch everybody in the audience. So out it comes, and you know, the bigger the place, the bigger the balloon, so you end up bringing Mr. Montgolfier and his enormous balloon. Then at the end of the show, the balloon has to deflate all the way down, and you have to resume normal service with the rest of humanity. That takes a few hours, I can tell you.Actually, some people never manage it, and they end up doing heroin or whatever the fuck they do, to try and adjust from that transition. The balloon is real and permanent, so they walk around with this permanent balloon and they can't manage to get through doorways or have a normal conversation with people. ""There's a hundred-foot balloon in front of me, look at me."" So it's a skill.When did you learn that skill? It's hard to put a finger on it. I started after the Number of the Beast tour. I realized that I could do this thing. I could project. I thought, ""I can't carry this thing around with me in everyday life."" And you're young, so what happens is you go on a high, you go out to clubs and bars and things, which I did back in the day a lot, and you have a few beers and all of a sudden here comes the big balloon. I've got a few beers, and it's like Jekyll and Hyde. Mr. Hyde comes out and he's onstage, and you have to learn how to deflate him and put him in his box and say, ""Back to bed now. Your day is done."" So I started dealing with it around the end of the Number of the Beast tour with varying degrees of success. I did fencing and doing these things culminating in me leaving the band, and then culminating in me learning to do it all over again. By the time I went back into Maiden, I had a much more balanced appreciation of what it was going to be like. Going back into Maiden, we did the Brave New World tour and everything, and I went, ""I know how to do this. I can blow up this bubble and I'm going to say that we're better than Metallica. That's going to fuckin' piss everybody off."" But I said it because I knew it would piss everyone off. I knew it wouldn't piss Metallica off, because they're Metallica. What do they care?On the subject of you leaving the band, I was surprised to read how disillusioned you were with performing in the mid-Eighties, well before you quit. Why was that? I was walking a thin line between self-criticism, self-doubt and the liability. You're in a very successful band, and they have a pretty defined style, and they're doing great. It doesn't seem to matter what they do, it sells. That worried me. I was like, ""If everybody is going around blowing smoke up your ass about how good this stuff is, how do you know it's really great?"" And that's the whole thing about papal infallibility: How could the Pope ever be wrong? He's the Pope, right? What if he is wrong?I really began to feel that that was what was going on with Maiden, and nobody else did. It culminated when I did one solo album [1990's Tattooed Millionaire], which did very well, actually, but it was a complete pastiche. There were a couple of good tunes. It was well executed, but it was like a Saturday Night Live version of a classic-rock album. There was a ballad sketch, there was a groovy sketch, there was an AC/DC sort of sketch. Literally. We assembled the record like that because we only had two weeks to write it. It was very successful, and I thought, ""That's kind of weird."" I thought, ""I'll have to do something different with the next one."" But nobody else wanted me to. They all said, ""Just do another one of those."" Everybody was happy with it, because it did well, but I was not happy with it. Artistically speaking, there was only one song on there that I thought was really good, which was ""Born in '58,"" and the rest of them were not earth-shattering.  We're not going to break the mold of the pantheon of rock music with this, and that's what you're looking for. With every album, you should be looking for the fucking holy grail, not just rearranging the ornaments on the altar. So that's what drove me with the next solo album [1994's Balls to Picasso]. But I had no clue about where to look for whatever the holy grail was. I realized that being in Maiden, I was immersed in the culture and I felt it had somehow enfeebled my artistic sense. In the meantime, I had left Iron Maiden and I think people around me thought there was a plan, and there wasn't. The song ""Tears of a Dragon"" â€“ ""I throw myself in the sea/Release the wave, let it wash over me"" â€“ that's where I was at. I was floating downstream going, ""I hope I end up on some kind of shore that's not too rocky."" That was it. I left Iron Maiden to find out what was beyond. If I'd stayed, I'd never have found out, because nobody was going to tell me the truth about anything I did.What's different now? Going back, it's been a whole different set of relationships with everybody. It's much more real, much more, in some ways, grown up. We all accept that some of the time we like each other, some of the time we don't, but we all get on because we have to get on. Our loyalty is not to each other; it's to the Iron Maiden mother ship, the one that gave birth to us, which it did. We all share everything a lot more now than we did way back then, so that's different. We are a lot more in control of what we do now as well, and not in a sort of obsessive-compulsive way, but simply in the way we say, ""Look, we're not going to do a 13-month tour,"" because we're going to be dead or in the funny farm.I said to my manager, ""We need to do amazing shows now. Back in the Eighties, we weren't doing amazing shows. We were doing a lot of shows, and you can't do amazing shows if you're doing a lot of shows, because your body just fades away and your voices break."" I felt like it more than anyone else back then. Before the Somewhere in Time tour, I just went into that tour going, ""I'm just going to be the singer; I'm going to stop trying so hard."" Then a couple albums later, I quit. Coming back, we started making some ground rules for ourselves. We said, ""Let's do three months touring a year, and we love it."" I really look forward to it. We all do. We like to work hard; we don't like to be destroyed. I love being in the band far more now than I did in the Eighties. It's much more fun now.One of the major turning points in the book was when you played a solo concert in Sarajevo, which was under siege during the Bosnian war at the time. How did that change your outlook on humanity? Well humanity is both incredibly inspirational and unbelievably disappointing when you go to a war zone. It brings out the best and the worst in every aspect of humanity. You get incredible acts of selflessness, and you get appalling acts of brutality and cruelty that are simply breathtaking, where you can't believe human beings could do such things to other human beings. Sarajevo was the longest siege in history; it was longer than the siege of Stalingrad. And this was in the latter half of the 20th century â€“ in Europe. People were living like rats. They were down to three days' supply of food and diesel, and they had no power. There's an amazing documentary that's been made about it [Scream for Me, Sarajevo]. He went back, and he interviewed a lot of the kids that were at the show, and said, ""How did it change your life?"" It's heartbreaking. There was a kid saying he was 11 years old, and his mom was crying because she couldn't feed them because they have no gas, no electricity, half the house was blown away. He said, ""Don't worry, mom."" And he went and burnt the furniture to boil water, and his mother was sobbing and he was saying, ""It'll be fine. I'll look after you."" That was in the beginning.It was brutal. To go into that, even for three or four days felt like a lifetime. To come out of it, to come back into the Western world in the full throes of Christmas and consumption and, ""Go buy this and buy that,"" I'm just sitting there going, ""I don't think anybody gets how unbelievably lucky we are to not be in that situation."" Sarajevo was a beautiful city. It was cultured. The 1984 Olympics were there. How could that possibly happen? And it did. People were murdering each other on a regular basis. You're thinking, ""Jesus. This is a heartbeat away from what could happen in any circumstance anywhere."" So you start getting impatient with people who seem to be self-centered and selfish. You go, ""Oh, you're just an asshole. Why don't we transplant you for five minutes onto the front line, see if you'd make a life there.""It seems like this has really stayed with you. It really has. You can only imagine what it's like for soldiers who exist in that environment for six months at a time, whether it's Iraq, Afghanistan, Sarajevo, Bosnia, even as peacekeepers. You see such terrible things.I used to fly as an airline pilot to Sierra Leone and used to stay for three or four days. Funnily enough, I used to fly there during the war, but we'd land and take off during the curfew. It didn't affect me as much as it did being in Sarajevo, because that was a shooting war, but it was harrowing in Sierra Leone. You'd go to the amputees' camp, and you'd see these people who had their arms and limbs hacked off by the rebels, and living in, literally, shit. They're living in a place with open sewers, shanty tents â€“ and this is the UN amputee center and you're going, ""Fuck."" These people have nothing, and they're the most generous, kind-hearted people you ever meet. It's a very sad, beautiful place. It has a similar effect, but not quite as much as Sarajevo in this way. I'm sure if you'd been there during the Ebola thing it would have been pretty harrowing for sure.The other major turning point in the book is your cancer. How did you deal with the depression and hopelessness? When I got diagnosed, it was like an out-of-body experience, like someone is talking to somebody else in the room. Like, ""Me? I have cancer? Really?"" Then you're thinking you might die. Then it's like, ""Do you feel sick? Maybe this is a terrible mistake,"" but you know it's not. So there's that moment. Then there's the acceptance: ""OK, what do we do with it? Let's make a plan and get on with it.""I thought, maybe I should be angry about this. Perhaps I should sit there and meditate and stab it with my steely knives, then I thought, ""That's exhausting. I have a feeling I'm going to leave all my strength to just get through the treatment. I can't waste all my energy hating things. That really is a waste of energy."" I've got chemo. I've got radiation. I've got to try and live my life and look beyond it. That's how I dealt with it. Then at the end of it, when I got the all clear, and you go, ""It's gone?"" You almost go, ""Really? I kind of miss it."" Because you've been living with it for three months. It's weird. It's like Stockholm syndrome. Then you're like, ""Don't be so fucking stupid."" You're almost afraid to step out into the light, because you've been in this dark place for three to six months. And then you sort of go, ""What do we make of the rest of life then?"" After eight, nine months, after starting to sing again and things like that, you finally come out of it, and I thought, ""Life is just amazing.""How has it changed you now? It hasn't changed my view of dying. Dying is absolutely inevitable, always has been, always will be, but it's made me change my view about living, which is that it's not the space between living and dying. Living is living now [touches the table], every minute, every second, for right now. Not because I think a bad thing is going to happen tomorrow, but because it's worth celebrating. Life is just a fucking amazing thing. That's the little gift that it gave me. That's one of the reasons why when I wrote the book, I wasn't going to write a shitty negative book. My book was going to say, ""Wow, isn't life great?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,Jonathan Bernstein,2018-01-08T13:20:00.000Z,Joan Baez Talks 'New Way of Expressing Myself' on First LP in a Decade,"joan baez, joan baez retirement, joan baez new album, joan baez whistle down the wind, joan baez album, joan baez politics, joan baez tour",Rolling Stone,"When Joan Baez, who recently announced that she'd be retiring from the road at the end of the year, began choosing music for her new album, she slowly found herself connecting to songs with a very specific set of emotions.  ""The direction this album went is that [2018] is going to be my last year of formal touring, and so there was a feeling, maybe not even spoken, but there was a strong feeling that it's time to move on,"" she tells Rolling Stone.The resulting album, Whistle Down the Wind, Baez's first in a decade, is a moving reflection and summation of Baez's life as a singer, musician and activist. Baez has gathered a collection of covers and original songs written for her by a cast of songwriters ranging from legends like Tom Waits and Mary Chapin Carpenter to indie darlings Anohni and Josh Ritter to lesser-known roots songwriters like Zoe Mulford, Tim Eriksen, and Eliza Gilkyson. ""What's happened, and I didn't do it on purpose, but the songs have become mine,"" says Baez, who turns 77 on Tuesday. ""That's when I know I'm on the right track.""The album, due March 2nd, was produced by Joe Henry (Bonnie Raitt, Billy Bragg, Allen Toussaint) during a series of sessions at Los Angeles' United Recording Studios. Rolling Stone is premiering the title track and lead single to Baez's new record, originally written by Tom Waits for his 1992 album Bone Machine, below. We recently spoke with Baez about her new album, her struggles with maintaining her voice and what might be next for her.It's been almost a decade since your most recent record. How long has this new album been gestating?It's been about a year, a year and a half. It starts off as a thought in my head and then my manager just tells me to start looking. I just run into certain songs that are just no-brainers. I'm very excited about this new album, I have to say. I don't always get this big a rush for a new record, but I recognize this as something totally different. Since the last album, my voice has changed so much, and it's not necessarily my choice. It's just what happens as you get older. Vocal cords need more and more work and they can never go back to what they were. So I have a new range and a new way of expressing myself, and it really reflects a lifetime of singing, among other things.Do you feel like you're continuously learning new things about your voice?Absolutely, I have to. I have to reinvent. I'm sure I thought I was reinventing 10 years ago.One of the most arresting moments on the new album is ""The President Sang Amazing Grace"" by Zoe Mulford. Is it true that you discovered that song by hearing it on the radio?I heard it on KPFA [in Berkeley]. I was just driving and I heard that song and I just pulled over. It's so expressive of my thoughts and feelings, which are pretty fucking gloomy, but she did it in such a beautiful way that's as dark as it is beautiful. In the concerts recently it's been for me probably the highlight. But I think with this batch of new songs there will probably be more than one highlight.How did you connect with Josh Ritter?He's traveled with me before. He's opened for me on the road, so I just asked him.  I said, ""You got anything up your sleeve?"" I can't remember which one he sent first, but I went, ""You got another one?"" And a couple hours later he had sent me another song. He's just amazing. Really lovely, he's just lovely. ""Silver Blade"" goes back to ""Silver Dagger,"" which is on my first album, which was in 1959 [laughs]. Josh made it sound like an old folk song, same with ""I Wish the Wars Were All Over."" They just sound like little pieces of old folk songs.Has Tom Waits ever specifically written a song for you?No, I've just found his music and I know that if I scratch the surface, I'll come up with something. I wish he would write something for me, but he didn't have to write ""Last Leaf"" for me; it was just there. It's a song about the timing in my life and it makes me laugh. But also, I am the last leaf on the tree for lots of folks.How often do you want to tweak songs others have written, either lyrically or musically?I leave them be, but sometimes, for instance, on ""The Things That We Are Made Of,"" I simply couldn't play what [Mary Chapin Carpenter] was playing. Her arrangement is much more complicated than anything I could do. I was in the studio and I was counting on the musicians and I said, ""Why don't you just do this and I'll sing to it."" It worked beautifully. Those guys, by the way, when you get in the studio and they're that high quality of musicians, it's just like a ride. When we work together it's just like a unit on a freight train because it moves so fast, really fast.You've said that 2018 is going to be your last full year of proper touring. Do you feel like you're done making albums as well?I've left that more open than the touring because you just can't ... you never know. Maybe you'll say, ""Oh, my God,"" and you'll want to do an album in other languages or some special project. But I doubt that I'll do this process again of finding songs and doing a whole album. Number one: It's too hard to sing. It's so difficult to sing. Nobody can really imagine the effort it takes to keep up with these vocal cords. They don't do what I want them to do anymore. When I stay in the low range, they do, pretty much. And I like the sound. But I can't do shit in the upper range anymore. I can kind of pop up there and get back down but the notes that I would sing before, nothing like that will ever happen again.""Nobody can really imagine the effort it takes to keep up with these vocal cords. ... I can't do shit in the upper range anymore.""&nbsp;That must be ...It's frustrating! It's frustrating until I remember that I don't need that, and that what I have is still unique, although it's different. And that in a way it is a reflection of this funny life of mine, that it would be silly if it were still this vocally pure soprano; it really wouldn't fit now. I am more ragged. I am more at peace, but I've also had a long life of raggedy stuff. And it comes out in the voice.John Prine has said that he felt like his old songs became new again when he had to relearn how to sing them after his voice dropped an octave following neck surgery. Have you had a similar experience with your older material?Yeah. I like that he said that. And also, almost all of us have tuned a guitar down half a note. Ones that even play better than I am even use a different key, but I just crack the whole thing down half a tone. And who knows, if I kept going I might have to do another half-tone down. I remember working with the Indigo Girls and we were trying to keep the pitch up; we were these four women who are past the point where we can really easily stay on pitch in a higher key. But the soul that's there really can't be beat, with me and the Indigos and Mary Chapin it's something that happens, and whether or not our vocal cords are really having problems, it's really magical.There's such a deep soulfulness to these new songs that shines through when you sing in this vocal register.That's important to me coming from somebody I assume is considerably younger than I am.Is it possible to pick a single song that best sums up the record?I think it would be ""Another World.""Why that song?I'm thinking about that, whether it sums up the record or just how I feel. It's funny because this record is like my very first records, in that there'd be these very socially conscious songs and then there'd be these pure ballads, songs that are just beautiful and aren't trying to tell anybody anything. But other songs have deeper meanings, so I don't know the answer. If I'm feeling folky, it'd be ""Silver Blade."" If I'm feeling political, then it would be ""Another World.""Do those moods change for you all the time, feeling folky or political?Yeah, they kind of do. The concerts are even more complicated, especially now, because I'm sort of winding things up, and people want to hear the old stuff, which we do anyway. That's always difficult, but I think it'll be easier with this new album, because the songs are all listener-friendly.Did the fact that this is your last year of touring affect the types of songs you chose for Whistle Down the Wind?I'm absolutely sure it did, and I also think a lot of it was unconscious.On Songs like ""Last Leaf"" and ""Be of Good Heart,"" there's a real sense of acceptance. You sound very at ease with where you are in your life.Well, it's true. By now, you could either shoot yourself or you could get peaceful. I'm choosing the latter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,Kory Grow,2017-10-27T15:07:00.000Z,Sex Pistols Break Down 'Never Mind the Bollocks' Track by Track,"sex pistols,never mind the bollocks,never mind the bullocks,never mind the bollocks here's the sex pistols,sex pistols interview,johnny rotten interview,john lydon interview,glen matlock interview,sex pistols track by track,anarchy in the uk",Rolling Stone,"""Bollocks was such a solid piece of work, yet when we were recording it, it felt anything but,"" says Johnny Rotten, looking back on the watershed 1977 LP Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. By his account, the group was working with a producer who was ""deaf in one ear and tone deaf in the other,"" and he and his bandmates had to cram a lot into their time in the studio.""Next door, Queen was recording one of their albums [News of the World] and Brian May asked me if I would do some backing vocals on their album,"" Rotten says. ""I don't remember which song, it's not the 'Galileo' one. But I went in and it was amazing to hear the way that Freddie [Mercury] recorded every line separately â€“ sometimes just a word â€“ and then they'd edit them. Bloody hell, I got one take and that's it; I'd get two if I made a mistake. I eventually realized that the music will overcome, regardless of the alleged rules and regulations that were always being thrown at us.""Ultimately, the Sex Pistols created the defining clarion call for punk mayhem. The record was a little less than 40 minutes of seething rock &amp; roll frustration aimed at anyone within gobbing distance, and their home country, in particular. And around the time Never Mind the Bollocks came out on October 28th, 1977, the band caused chaos as much as it inspired anarchy. Its singles were blacked out on the British charts, a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying the album cover, and the band â€“ banned all over England â€“ had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. (that's ""Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly""). In short, the LP was a success. It made it to Number One in the U.K. and was certified double platinum there, and in the U.S., where Rolling Stone called the group ""the most incendiary rock &amp; roll band since the Rolling Stones and the Who,"" it ultimately became one of the only first-wave punk records to be certified platinum. Forty years later, the album still smacks of vitriol. While other bands on both sides of the Atlantic helped set the bar for punk fury, the combo of Rotten's cutting vocals, guitarist Steve Jones' stomping riffs and drummer Paul Cook's crashing cymbals â€“ not to mention bass appearances by original four-stringer Glen Matlock, who left the group in 1977, and his replacement, Sid Vicious â€“ amplified the menace of songs like ""Anarchy in the U.K."" and ""God Save the Queen"" into national threats. Bollocks was a cultural force and subsequently made it into the Top 50 of Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.The album's legacy will soon be the focus of a comprehensive 40th-anniversary box set. The collection includes the original album, a disc of rarities, another containing live recordings from Europe, a 48-page book and a DVD featuring several live performances on the S.P.O.T.S. tour, as well as the band's&nbsp;infamous riverboat party on the Thames during the Queen's jubilee celebrations. (""I was drunk at the time; I had no idea what day it was,"" Rotten says of that gig now.) The collection previously came out in a limited edition in 2012 but quickly went out of print. Since none of the band members are considering re-forming or making another album, the box set could be the final, definitive statement on the Sex Pistols.These days, Rotten goes by his given name of John Lydon and is dedicated to his post-Pistols art-rock group Public Image Ltd., Jones hosts the radio show Jonesy's Jukebox, Cook is releasing a new record with the Professionals called What in the World,&nbsp;and Matlock is touring as a solo artist and has recorded a new album with the Stray Cats' Slim Jim Phantom with the working title of Cloud Cuckoo Land that will come out early in 2018. (The ever-volatile Sid Vicious died of a drug overdose in 1978). To mark the album's anniversary, Rotten and Matlock spoke with Rolling Stone to break down every track of one of the most venomous albums in rock history.""Holidays in the Sun""Johnny Rotten: We decided to have a holiday as band en masse and we grouped ourselves in the Channel Islands and they immediately rejected us. As Sex Pistols, we found ourselves banned just about everywhere. They wouldn't let us stay at any hotel. We marched up and down the beaches looking for somewhere to stay and the whole thing became really pathetic. We bumped into the local gang and the top boy accommodated us for one evening and then we left.Steve and Paul went home, and me and Sid decided to go to Berlin, because it was the maddest place to go. Me and Sid were thinking, ""Bloody hell, if we can't get into somewhere as soft as the Channel Islands, let's go find out what the Berlin Wall is about."" And that whole experience was thrilling for me, and that's where ""Holidays in the Sun"" came from. It was great fun. It was us, from our side, looking over the wall and [the Germans] are pointing guns at us. We couldn't get into East Berlin. They just took one look at us and went, ""No.""Matlock: ""Holidays"" is a good song they wrote after I left. There was a song by the Jam called ""In the City"" [that it sounded like] and I know that Sid went down to the Speakeasy Club, which was the rock-star after hours club, and wound up Paul Weller, who is a mate of mine, about them having a song that's very similar to the Jam song â€“ and Paul bottled him. I'm on Paul's side. ""Bodies""Rotten: Pauline, in the song, was a very, very crazy disturbed person. You would probably call her a stalker these days, but in the early days we never had the term for it. She was just one of them annoying girls that wouldn't take no for an answer. She was just turning up all the time and had an unpleasant attitude; she was clingy.The song is about abortion, and yes, it is a woman's right [to choose] absolutely because she has to bear the child and all the issues thereinafter. Is it wise to bring an unwanted child into the world? No, I don't think it is, but again that is just my opinion, because I always would leave it to the woman. Always. In that song I raise both sides of the agenda and actually put myself in there, too. If it wasn't for the grace of God, my mother could have had an abortion and I wouldn't be here.The ""fuck this and fuck that"" line wasn't improvised; I wrote that down. That was just my anger at the end of it. That was my frustration of what on earth is the right answer, and it was my honest gut reaction: ""Fuck this, fuck that/Fuck it all and fuck the fucking brat/I don't want a baby that looks like that/I don't want a baby that looks like that."" And then I'm crying as the baby, ""Mommy, I'm not an animal/Daddy, I'm not an abortion."" It's the duality of life, like, what's the right decision? It's very serious because it's about the termination of a fellow human being, which I don't take lightly.""No Feelings""Matlock: Musically, it was mainly Steve's original idea. He was trying to be a bit New York Dollsâ€“y, I suppose. The original bass line I played on it during the ""No feelings"" bit was my hats-off to Trevor Bolder from [David Bowie's] Spiders From Mars in ""Hang Onto Yourself."" Rotten: I wrote ""No Feelings"" because my Dad was sponsoring a lot of orphans at the time, and one of the girls just became too attached to me. I had to tell her, ""Look, I have no feelings. Just because my dad is letting you stay at his house for the weekend doesn't mean you can marry me."" But there's this sad truth of orphans, which I have always donated money to, and that's that they grow up with a prison-like mentality. They're not attached to anybody or anything, so they're very desperate and very clingy to anything that they can translate very quickly into love, and it's false love. It's really desperation. I'm so wounded for them in that respect. In the song it may seem like I have no empathy, but it's the exact opposite. It's irony. ""Liar""Rotten: Many, many people inspired ""Liar,"" starting with the manager [Malcolm McLaren]. We were just hapless young idiots really and we were really unprepared for the world of greed and adulthood that we were thrown into so quickly. Everyone had their piece of poisonous influence to whisper in your ear, and that could cause great division. So I just came around to the point where instead of allowing division, I would unleash my derision. But the song isn't totally about Malcolm. I think we always knew that about him, and in an odd way, it was one of his most adorable features. Do you know when you really know someone, you kind of accept those kinds of things because you take everything with a pinch of salt? It's the [people outside of the band] I am really aiming at: those who are trying to maneuver into us. Matlock: That was more of a free-for-all kind of a song. We all came up with parts. I remember John was stuck for a bit with the lyrics and I said, ""Why don't you use the word 'suspension'?"" He said, ""What do you mean, 'suspension'?"" I said, ""It's like something when you're at school, like, 'You're in suspension,' but it also means you're sort of just dangling there."" And he went, ""Ah, I don't want to do that,"" and the next thing is, he's got it in the song.""God Save the Queen""Matlock: I came up with the riff and main set of chord changes for this when we were starting to do the first proper recordings of ""Anarchy."" We'd given our sound engineer, Dave Goodman, the go at being the producer, but it didn't work out and we went on strike and we rang up Chris Thomas. There was a piano in the studio; I can't play the piano, but I've fiddled around and I can play ""Blueberry Hill"" if you want to hear that. But I came up with this riff on it. I worked it out on the guitar and I said, ""I've got a song."" And John had a set of lyrics. Rotten: I'd written this down as one solid piece. We did quite a bit with [producer] Chris Spedding before doing the album, and he taught me aspects of song structure and how to not ignore the music and just to stop ranting. Music was new to me. Even though I had bought records ever since I can remember, it's quite different to be in the studio trying to keep in time with the tune and fit the words in. To me, the lyrics themselves were a fun thing. It was expressing my point of view on the Monarchy in general and on anybody that begs your obligation with no thought. That's unacceptable to me. You have to earn the right to call on my friendship and my loyalty. And you have to have value-proven points in order for me to support you. That's how it is. Matlock: And that song was originally called ""No Future."" And when it came out, after I left the band, it occurred to somebody, maybe Malcolm that although the words were never changed, it was the Queen's silver jubilee and the first line is ""God save the Queen,"" so why don't we call it that. But on early set lists it was called ""No Future.""Rotten: I think that the song was misunderstood as a personal attack [on the Monarchy]. It wasn't. It's absolutely anti the institution of monarchy, but not them as people. Oh, my God, they get my heartfelt sympathy; I feel they have been born into a birdcage. There is no way out because there is nothing to compare it to, other than the entrapment of rule and regulation. When I sing, ""They made you a moron,"" it's because being blind to obligation is moronic, isn't it? And when I sang, ""No future,"" I meant that there was no future if [the Monarchy] were to accept that kind of thing. They are slowly but surely shape-shifting into a very nice middle-class family with 3.4 children. I love the pageantry. I associate that with football. I like that flag waving and all of it, 'cause it's colorful and it's exciting to want to feel that you belong to something. Even though you might not like the institution itself, it's still intriguingly British. And that's a wonderful thing and no one can take that away from me. I'm an Irishman who is intrinsically British. ""Problems""Rotten: When I say, ""The problem is you,"" it's really everyone, including myself. I think everyone is unhappy with yourself when you're a teenager. That's par for the course, and we're all part of the brave front that, ""Yeah, I'm well on top and confident,"" but none of us are. That's what being a teenager is, isn't it? It's learning that you're now waltzing into the world of decision-making and you better well be prepared for it. And you try and fight that off as much as you can. It's chaos. Problems were all the way through us as a band. I don't know if we ever bothered to sit down and work out why we were a group. We not only appeared to the public as not liking each other, I think we genuinely didn't. It was the longest year and a half I've ever lived. I think all of us feel that way. When we talk, it all feels like a solid decade was crunched into such a tiny space of time. It was mentally draining and exhausting. I know what kept me in the band, though: I had utter, complete respect for them as players. I knew we were all learning, but I really liked what everyone was learning. I was absolutely thrilled to be near Mr. Jones' guitar. The stability of Paul's drumming will always impress me. Poor old Sid couldn't play. Lemmy once said it best, ""Sid, you're tone deaf."" Sid had all the poses down but not much else, but so what? Sometimes that is what we needed and that's what we got. It's my fault for bringing him in; it introduced a whole new bunch of problems. And well, we got a song out of it. ""Seventeen""Matlock: This was an idea that we had been working on before John was in the band. It was originally Steve's lyric, and then John adapted that.Rotten: Steve's song called ""Lonely Boy,"" it's kind of really basic, and I just grabbed hold of it and turned it into teenage angst. I titled it ""Seventeen,"" because that's the age when everything hurts the most. You're not quite an adult, you don't want to be viewed as a young whippersnapper, and you're not fully prepared for adulthood either. And all due reference to Alice Cooper's ""Eighteen,"" [when I titled this ""Seventeen""], I thought, ""Well, Americans start late."" When I sang, ""You're only 29,"" I was probably singing to myself. My mom and my dad always used to say, ""Oh, you were born an old man, and since you joined that band, you seem to be becoming a child."" ""How old do you think I was when I was born?"" ""45,"" said my dad. So it's a fair estimate that between 17, 18 and 45 would be 29.The rest of the lyrics were representing everybody around me, since these are not lonely-boy problems; this is what everybody faces, but nobody faces up to. A good book is when an author tells you the truth and you can tell because they are embarrassing themselves doing it. But facing up to that truth is so important to the readers because it helps them break out of their shells. So when I sang, ""I don't work, I just speed,"" that was a sad, lovely, adorable part of my life. It's sad because I didn't have enough booze and speed [laughs]. I mean I had to give all that up really when I joined the band because you can't afford to do that. You have to concentrate on the one thing now that's the big issue. As far as the ""lazy sod"" part, the band really was a full-on 24/7 kind of situation. And then of course came the trying-to-tour and the banning. Every time a gig is canceled, it's a major rejection because you go through all the fears and phobias of not wanting to let people down. And then some other people let you down by canceling it; that's a stress. ""Anarchy in the U.K.""Matlock: Around the summertime, we were rehearsing and once again I said, ""Does anybody got any ideas?"" And I had a go at Steve, 'cause I felt I was pushing the band along a bit, but that time he had something, which wasn't much. And he said, ""Why don't you come up with something?"" And I had half an idea for a big overture, and I just started playing that descending chord progression and everybody picked up on it and said, ""Where's it go next?"" And I sort of geared it as we went along. John, it happened, had a bag of lyrics â€“ just sheets of paper in a plastic bag â€“ and he pulled something out and he said, ""I've been waiting for you to come up with something because I've got this idea."" Everybody had been talking about this guy, Jamie Reid, who did our artwork, and he was a bit of an agitprop kind of guy about anarchy. And John had written these lyrics. Rotten: I have always thought that anarchy is mind games for the middle class. It's a luxury. It can only be afforded in a democratic society, therefore kind of slightly fucking redundant. It also offers no answers and I hope in my songwriting I'm offering some kind of answer to a thing, rather than spitefully wanting to wreck everything for no reason at all, other than it doesn't suit you. I've always got to bear in mind I'm part of a community called the human race and an even tighter community called culture. Why would we want to destroy these things willy-nilly?I didn't realize how many professional anarchists were out there â€“ and still are. Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson declared himself as an anarchist, this is how absurd it can get. A boy in makeup in a corset don't cut it for me; Alice Cooper did, but that's it. One of them is enough in my life.Matlock: We'd already recorded it in 1976, and that's how my playing ended upon the album. I remember talking with Duff McKagan, who watched a gig once and came up and said, ""Glen, I didn't realize you play all that type of Motown stuff."" And on ""Anarchy,"" I'm trying to emulate James Jamerson. Rotten: The phrase ""I am an antichrist/I am an anarchist"" really upset Glen Matlock a lot, and I couldn't understand why he picked that. He was, I don't know if ""harsh critic"" would be the words, but he was always looking for the softer touch. That's what leads to the fractional-ism between Glen and me.Matlock: It's not true that I didn't like the lyrics. The only line that always made me wince was, ""I am an antichrist/I am an anarchist"" â€“ they don't rhyme, and it always gets me. Songs that don't rhyme properly gets me somehow. It had nothing to do with the sentiment. But if you then want to go onto a whole sociopolitical argument about whether it is a good thing to have real anarchy in the U.K. and whether that's ever going to happen is another matter. But I was quite proud to be onstage singing that song.Rotten: On the original demo, at the start of the song, I sang ""Words of wisdom"" before ""right now"" and I removed it because there is no point of overdoing it. I always thought if I over-aggrandized it, it wouldn't mean much. When we were rehearsing we always tried to remove what was superfluous; we took out all the extra guitar flurries â€“ Steve willingly did that most sensibly â€“ and Paul would cut a song down to its simple roots. So with the lyrics, it's always for an audience to decide. You can't be dictating, like, ""Hello, this is genius, here it comes."" [Laughs]. You'll start off at 10. I prefer the preciseness of opening the song with, ""Right now."" When we recorded the official version, getting that ""Rrright now"" was really hard to do. It took me time. They would be telling me to count the beats, and I didn't know what the fuck they meant â€“ what are beats? Paul would always be very helpful with me, but at the same time it was infuriating because I wouldn't know the terminology.""Sub-Mission""Matlock: We used to rehearse at a venue called the Roundhouse. They had rehearsal rooms downstairs, and they was recording a classical concert that was going out live, and we was making too much noise. And they came down and asked us to turn down, but we paid our money so we wasn't going to. So I'm sure somewhere in Zimbabwe or Rhodesia, you heard the early versions of the Sex Pistols going out underneath Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. So we started rehearsing that and, one day, Steve and Paul couldn't be asked to turn up. So me and John waited and waited, and they didn't turn up, so we went to the pub over the road and he said to me, ""You seen Malcolm?"" And I said, ""Yeah, he said, 'Why don't you write a song called 'Submission'?"" And John said, ""What? All about bondage and domination and all that old shite?"" And I said, ""Yeah, I guess so."" And one of us, I don't remember which one of us, said ""How about 'Submarine Mission'?""Rotten: Writing this song was one of the best times I have ever had with Glen. We really just wanted to get drunk and sneer at each other, but we got through that early phase and just wrote quite well. What Malcolm was asking for was some kind of submission from the pair of us, so I turned it into a submarine mission. Matlock: So John said, ""I'm on a submarine mission for you, baby."" And I came up with, ""I could see the way you were going."" Then he went, ""I picked you up on my TV screen."" And I said, ""I can feel your undercurrent flowing."" We just sat there over a pint trading lines and I went home that night and I worked out some chords to go over it and when we met up with the guys the next time, there was the song. It was fun.Rotten: ""Sub-Mission"" is the closest thing to a love song we did and that's written by two people that didn't like each other [laughs]. It's too easy to write a nasty piece of animosity against each other. Both of us are capable of that, but why bother you know? Let's take it to higher grounds, find something that we both like: a genuine love of human beings.""Pretty Vacant""Rotten: That's another thing done that night with Glen. Glen had this idea of the band being like, as he put it, ""Soho poofs,"" I suppose very much like Oscar Wilde, which is where I thought he was coming from. We're not talking like overtly gay overtures here or anything like that; it's really just the style of dressing. And that's never how I have seen myself. I couldn't imagine Mr. Rotten in frills and lace. And so ""Pretty Vacant,"" the concept, turned into really just kind of a football chant. And it was adopted on the terraces by quite a few firms â€“ firms being gangs of hooligans.Matlock: Malcolm McLaren had been going back and forth to the States to be involved in the rag trade and buy old Fifties clothes because he had a Teddy Boy shop, and I knew he ran into Sylvain Sylvain from the New York Dolls and went backstage. Malcolm came back with fliers for the shows and he brought back set lists, but none of these bands had made records at that stage. One said ""Blank Generation,"" and that got me thinking about how there was nothing going on in London, and there was a real air of despondency and desperation, so I came out with the idea of ""Pretty Vacant."" I had the set of chord changes and the lyric but I was short of a riff. I knew it needed a melodic thing, and I heard something on a record by a band called Abba and it inspired the riff I needed, and I said, ""Guys, I've got it."" I mentioned the Abba influence in an interview once and the bass player from Abba somehow got my address and started sending me Christmas cards for about 10 years. John sang the lyrics, but we played so loud in the rehearsal that I didn't know for months that he changed the lyrics in the second verse â€“ ""No cheap comments, because we know what we feel."" We couldn't bloody hear him. That song was our statement somehow.Rotten: There is an irony in that song because we weren't very pretty, and we were far from vacant. Again I need to repeat myself to explain these songs correctly. I never considered myself pretty or vacant. Maybe I should, would have had an easier life. I'd be dead wrong, but it would have been really easy. No, you can't get sucked up into the system, can't allow that. And I sang it ""Pretty Va-cunt"" as a sneaky one on my behalf. ""New York""Rotten: That's a reference to the New York Dolls. I don't think of it as vicious; it's absolutely bang on from Babylon. ""I'm looking for a kiss."" They're mates of mine, and nobody has ever raised a complaint and why would they? It's not a personal attack. You have to understand at the time in England, glam rock was old hat by this point. We were overrun with Sweet, T. Rex â€“ David Bowie got out of it rather well â€“ but there were many, many bands like that in tight pants and lipstick. It was enough all right, already.The bands in New York all seemed to be a little bit older and to have a little bit more of mommy's money in it, to me, rather than having to squeak by [with] all manner of ferrety streetwise methods. They were a little spoiled, and maybe I was little jealous of the luxury zone that they could all propagate amongst each other and prop each other up. And using ties like Rimbaud poetry to connect, I thought it was all very fake. I mean, I read that [Rimbaud] stuff when I first went to New York and thought, ""This isn't good enough."" It just isn't. It doesn't have that tough edge of life's experiences in it. And there it is and that was the difference really between the English scene and the American punk scene. The American scene was a bit hoity-toity, a bit privileged and a bit snooty about its art. ""Fuck art, let's dance"" would be more my methodology. Matlock: Musically, ""New York"" was originally my idea. I know you had a program in America called Secret Agent [with the opening theme ""Secret Agent Man""] but in England [where it was called Danger Man] it had a different theme tune. And I was trying to write a rock version of something like that. So my original set of chord changes was like that on the bass but then John came out with the taking-the-mickey-out-of-theâ€“New York Dolls lyric and it just came together. It's not one of my favorite songs, to be honest. Rotten: The word ""faggots"" in the song is not about the New York Dolls because they most certainly were not. It's out to an audience that just wants to misinterpret everything. And you have to bear in mind that faggots in England, at the time, I remember this â€“ I had seen an advert for it in London â€“ it was a Northern dish: faggots and gravy. And they were trying to introduce it to Southern England with this hideous advert. I can't remember the company, but it was a product that would never wash well with a Londoner. It might not come off that way in the song, but that is exactly where I took the references from and I do that a lot. Whatever the scenario around me is, I will absorb. When in Rome.""EMI (Unlimited Edition)""Rotten: EMI wanted to sign us to show what a grand, varied label they were, but they really were not. This song was fun to write. It was actually mostly done in the studio because the groove was there, and it was relentless. It was a lovely hypnotic trance-like state to get into. They just wanted to be famous and for us to make a lot of money for them and that was it. And that was a real bit of disappointment with this lot coming out of the hippie generation, shall we say, and they were so commercially wrapped up inside profit that it led to their ultimate decline. That's why we'd have T-shirts like, ""Never trust a hippie."" It was well aimed [laughs].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,Rolling Stone,2018-02-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Jake Shears Shares Bono's Advice, David Bowie's Cryptic Note of Support","scissor sisters, jake shears",Rolling Stone,"It's been almost six years since Scissor Sisters released their fourth album, Magic Hour, and now lead singer Jake Shears has gone solo. ""Creep City, the first single from his forthcoming album, hews close to his glam-rock roots. But that's not enough for Shears, who is currently starring as Charlie Prince in Kinky Boots on Broadway and releasing Boys Keep Swinging, his memoir about how he went from being a shy Arizona teenager to performing in gay nightclubs in New York (and dating Anderson Cooper along the way), and eventually filling arenas with hits like ""Take Your Mama,"" ""I Don't Feel Like Dancin'"" and a cult-hit cover of Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb."" The following excerpt from the book details the height of Scissor Sisters' success at the 2010 Glastonbury Festival, and his encounters with Bono and David Bowie in New York City.By midnight at Glastonbury I was in a stupor, could barely feel myself walking on the wet grass. The second set had been a gorgeous assault on my own senses. Chris had stood there smiling with his camera in hand, waiting for me as I exited the side of the stage. It was all happening at once. We'd played on the main Pyramid stage in the afternoon, done hours of press afterward, and then played the Dance tent at 11.The daytime set on the Pyramid stage had been lighthearted: We'd played as the crowd was bathed in a gentle, temporary rain. Ana had some great lines like ""If you holler loud enough, a big sunny rainbow is going to shoot out of Jake's ass!"" There was nothing purer than us surprising one another with a quick joke or a look. Or sometimes we'd literally just fall on our asses, which was never not hilarious.The Dance tent show had been almost the opposite. The crowd's simmer had quickly turned into a boil from the top of the set, creating an energy so boisterous and electric, it almost felt devilish. We ended with absolute chaos, all of our freak friends and creatures joining us onstage. I wore a catsuit printed with hundred-dollar bills. It was the first time we'd had an audience that large, teeming with an expectation that we were fulfilling in front of their eyes. It was like I'd harnessed a new level of control, and the sensation was overwhelmingly satisfying. I got offstage and Chris and Christoph and I were ready to party.We met up with my friends Kat and Will, traipsed across the entire festival to head to Lost Vagueness, a section of the festival that was known for its jaw-dropping installations and debauchery. I had a pocketful of MDMA, and even though I was completely spent, the exhilaration from the shows had me floating. I'd walk along crowded trails sticking my hands out behind me for Chris to hold.As though some switch had been thrown, suddenly everyone knew who I was. Strangers were happy to see me at every step, scream- ing and hugging me like long-lost friends. It was my first taste of this kind of thing. It's an incredible feeling, when people you've never met before are thrilled to just see you; when you walk into a party or stroll down the street and they just want to talk to you and hug you.We ended up in some '50s-style diner playing oldies on the juke- box and didn't move from there the whole night. Little Richard screeched as salty waitresses walked around with pots of coffee. The place looked exactly like an old greasy spoon, down to the checkered floors and ketchup bottles. We danced well into the next day.I fell in love with Chris that night. In a moment of absolute clarity and inspiration I asked him if he'd marry me. He said yes. It was our first date. I just inexplicably knew he was the one I would be spending my life with.We sat in the grass by the stone circle monument, a popular gath- ering spot at Glastonbury with twenty standing stones, where people play drums and lie about in the grass. Fog rolled through, the silhou- ettes of festivalgoers just barely perceptible through the mist. I held Chris's hand and kissed him again, both of us knowing that our lives had just dramatically changed in a matter of hours.I thought about being alone on that beach in Barcelona, years before, dressed as a mime, knowing this moment would arrive. And here it was. I don't know if I've ever experienced such pure, unadulterated happiness. Our album went to No.1 in the UK charts the following Tuesday  and stayed there. It would be the highest-selling album in the country that year.We were in New York for just one night. The band was performing at PS1 for a summer Warm Up partyâ€”the same party that had started when I lived at the Cake Factory, where I first saw Fischerspooner, where I spent so many wild and sweltering afternoons, slugging back beer and dancing. We were playing the steps of the museum. The turnout was in the thousands.I asked Klaus Biesenbach, the director of the museum, if there was a place away from everyone that Chris and I could go spend a few minutes together. He took us to a sparsely furnished but airy room with a couch that overlooked the courtyard.We had a perfect view of the entire crowd.It was the only time Chris and I would have alone that day. We put the hour to good use. Afterward I lay in his arms and gently dozed off. When I extracted myself from his naked limbs, my face bleary, I sat up on the couch. ""I think it's time. I need to go down and start getting dressed,"" I said.""Where's your mom?"" He looked around us, as if we had lost her in the room. I laughed.""Oh, I'm sure she's making new friends."" I reached over to the window and pulled back the shade. The courtyard was jammed with people waiting for the show. They spotted us and started cheering. We were shirtless, with our arms around each other, smiling in our post-sex glow. It was as if they were celebrating the fact we'd just found the loves of our lives.I got down to the dressing room and Bono was there, wearing his sunglasses and perusing our looks for the day's show. ""There he is, the man of the hour."" He reached out and hugged me. My mom's eyes bugged out as he gave her a hug as well.""I didn't know you would be here,"" I said to him like an idiot.""If you knew everything that was going to happen, then there would be no surprises,"" he replied.We played a killer show that day. I wore Vivienne Westwood shorts that tied all the way up on the side, half obscene, making me look naked, thin black suspenders, a leather cap, and a giant feather brooch. The stage was set up at the top of the front museum stairs, but behind a railing, so I spent most of the performance climbing it and standing on the edge, singing. The crowd was a sea, and I felt like I was crossing over it on the bow of my own party boat.Afterward, in a James Turrell room called Meeting with no ceil- ing, only an unobstructed blue sky above us, Bono gave a toast. ""To these times that we will never forget, to pop music, to family. One day we will all look back at this and realize how truly blessed we all are to get to experience such beautiful moments."" I sat holding Chris's hand. ""May the journey be long and fruitful.""Bono then pulled me aside and gave me ""the talk.""""Jake, you have a road in front of you, you do realize that, yes?"" His voice was serious. ""You have decisions to make. Hey."" He splayed his hands. ""This can be just a moment in time. And that's fine. But it can be more than that, you see. This â€” music â€” can be your life. There's two paths you can choose. One, you can go and get caught up in all the parties and attention, become interested in art. Or you can remain focused and just keep making music. Building something that lasts more than just now."" I've since heard that he gives this talk to a lot of younger artists, but his words stuck with me.That night, Chris, my mom, and I got to my apartment and it turned out the roommate I had at the time hadn't found another place to sleep, which he had agreed to do that night because he hadn't been paying rent. My mom, such a trooper, ended up sleeping in his bed with him. She could see how excited Chris and I were just to be able to spend a few more hours together. ""For God's sake, please don't tell your father,"" she said. We were in such good spirits, someone could have robbed us at gunpoint and we would have thought it hilarious Chris and I got in bed together and laid our heads on the pillow, looked into each other's faces horizontally. We both actually squealed as we embraced. That moment was the most in love with anyone that I had ever been.The summer heat had stuck around that following fall in New York City. I stepped into a sunset-kissed Union Square in destroyed black cowboy boots and a Heatherette tie-dyed hoodie with Amanda Lepore's face stenciled on the front. Waiting there to greet me was Chris, roses in hand. We were playing Irving Plaza that night. It was a show I'd been looking forward toâ€”a homecoming of sorts. We'd received sad news that day about a friend's child passing away. There was a dark pall over the dressing room. It turned out to be the first show in New York that we played where I looked out at the crowd and didn't recognize a soul. Who are these people? I thought. Where were our friends? For the first time I felt homesick in my own city. That night I just didn't connect with the audience.After we said our final goodbye from the stage, I trod up the stairs back to the dressing room where Chris took my arm and said, ""David Bowie watched the show.""""What?"" All the bustle of the room quickly tuned out, and all I could hear was the ringing in my ears.""He was up in the balcony."" ""Which side?""""Your left.""I suddenly started babbling. ""Is he still here? Why didn't anybody say anything? How come no one told me? The show was fucking ter- rible! I was fucking terrible. . . ."" I paced in a circle, feeling my throat closing up, trying to hold back tears. I stopped and pulled it together, put on a clean shirt, and prepared myself to meet him. He never came backstage. He was gone.Growing up, no matter what I was doingâ€”whether it was theater, tap dancing, or writing horror storiesâ€”his sounds and visions guided my way. And now he had seen my shitty show and left. I was incon- solable. They say never meet your idols. I guess the only thing worse than meeting your idols is not meeting them. The whole thing made me feel like a fraud.Later that month, I received a somewhat cryptic email:Hi. I came to your show a few weeks ago. It sounded very good from where I was sitting. dbI froze. What was this? As if I didn't know he'd been there? From where he was sitting? As opposed to where everyone else was sitting? This just exacerbated my pain. Why did he even bother to write me an email at all? The black type on white just read to me as: ""Dear Jake, though you may think yourself a rock star, you will never be me. David Bowie.""My response took about three weeks to compose. I made sure that even if it was a little longer, at three sentences, I kept it equally terse:Dear David Bowie,You mean more to me than any artist on earth. My favorite song you've ever written is ""Fantastic Voyage."" Thank you so much for coming to my show, but I really hope at this point that we never cross paths. There's not a lot in this world I keep sacred, but I would rather you just stay imaginary.Sincerely, Jake ShearsNow I realize that it was my insecurities that made me prickle. I felt like I didn't deserve to be so close to what I knew to be greatness. David Bowie, the man who gave me the idea and inspiration to per- form in the first place, sent me a note to just tell me he liked my show, and I couldn't just see that for what it was. I wish I'd just replied with a simple ""Thank you.""Copyright Â© 2018 by Jason Sellards.

""There is no time where I feel like I will fall off,"" says the hot young rapper. Only last year, he released his first batch of songs on SoundCloud and now, thanks to his breakout A Love Letter to You mixtape and ""Fuck Love,"" a Top 40 single with controversial rapper XXXTentacion, he finds himself fielding calls from Kanye West, Drake and 21 Savage. ""I feel like I will always last,"" declares the 18-year-old born Michael White IV. ""I will always do something new."" If Trippie seems overly optimistic, it's because the slurry, emo-heavy hip-hop he makes is one of the hottest sounds dominating the pop charts. Similar-minded artists like Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti and Lil Pump have seen their star rise alongside him, but in Trippie's mind only he and XXX have mastered the craft: ""I've perfected this style. I'm not necessarily even a part of all the new-wave shit. Me and X, I feel like we're in our own little category. We're the only artists I know who are phat that are on something else. We're timeless.""Signed to the label owned by the son of UMG Chairman Lucian Grainge, Trippie points to the success of ""Love Scars"" â€“ his breakout track that's been streamed more than 17 million times on Spotify and more than 12 million times on YouTube â€“ as the turning point in his young career. ""I really felt it after that,"" he says of a burgeoning fame that's included being championed by Lil Wayne, Lil Uzi Vert and Chris Brown. ""To just be in the situation I'm in now and taking myself from depression to happiness, it's all a blessing.""For the Canton, Ohio native, music was long an emotional outlet. Born to a single-mother and an incarcerated father, Trippie's older brother, who performed as Dirty Redd, turned him onto hip-hop before dying in a car accident in 2014. Trippie first recorded alternative rock music before turning his attention to hip-hop, but no matter the genre Redd, who cites everyone from Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ© to Nirvana and Kiss as inspiration, says music was always his coping mechanism ""I was depressed. I didn't have nobody,"" he says of the years following his brother's death. ""I was on my own type shit. Music took me from a real dark place to a real bright one.""Not that everyone in his life believed he could make a career of music. ""My mom would be saying shit like, ""You can't always think about music. You gotta get a regular job."" But I didn't want to get no regular job,"" Trippie says. ""I worked at Little Caesar's for about two days, bro. I was out. That's the only job I've ever had."" After graduating high school, he moved to Atlanta where he struck up a friendship with the rapper Lil Wop and networked with the city's hip-hop elite. White recorded three projects there â€“ Awakening My Inner Beast, Beast Mode and Rock the World Trippie â€“ before relocating to Los Angeles and signing with Grainge. Despite logging countless hours in the studio, Trippie is the first to admit his come-up has happened quickly. ""It's still crazy,"" he says. ""It's wild. I knew it was going to happen. I just didn't know it was going to happen so soon. I done elevated. I've made hella fans. I got a big-ass family now. All around it only took like a year of dedication and motivation.""With red-tinged dreadlocks, a mouth full of gold teeth and several face tattoos, Trippie says people are often quick to judge him based solely on his looks, but ultimately he believes his music-industry accomplishments will be the ultimate decider. ""You can't say shit about me until I die,"" he says. ""If I die and I gotta couple Grammys on me, more than a couple hits on me, I got some plaques and I got billboards still up and I done touched a lot of people's souls and I'm viral, once that happen then you can judge all you want. I don't give a fuck. I'm dead. I'm gone. I did what I did.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
